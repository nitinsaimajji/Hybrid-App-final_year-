"I'm looking for a large dataset of n-grams (preferably 4-grams or 5-grams, though bigrams or trigrams might also work), in order to get some cooccurrence data. Are there any such datasets (freely) available?

Sadly, it looks the Google n-grams datasets (http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html -- not the more recently released book n-grams) now cost $150 + shipping.

I thought I'd heard that Bing also provided n-grams datasets (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/cs/web-ngram.aspx), but it looks like all the access is through some limited API, so (unless I'm missing something) I can't find all the cooccurrences for a given word X.

Are there any other datasets available / am I misunderstanding what Bing provides? Or is my only option to just pony up and pay for the Google data?",not_spam

Then, as a second step, it'd be great to have the correct data to draw my own state congressional districts and derive partisan leans (as well as determine the racial makeup). But, this would be a much larger project for the future.

"I wanted to do a very simple regression analysis on crime data in America. I can find very general sets online, but does anyone know of how to get ahold of as close to source data as possible? I'm actually looking for something more along the lines of arrest records, as opposed to crimes, however, due to related nature of the two, I would be looking for either.

I'm looking for something along the lines of a large tableset with columns being potentially: ""Arrest index""/""specific arrest"", ""income"", ""zip code"", ""race"", and whatever other values that may be available.

The point of my project would be to see which has a higher correlation for being arrested, race, or income.

Obviously, both are going to be big factors, but comparing the two would be enlightening for me, and help guide me with another analysis afterwards.

I added zip code, because in lieu of income, zip can be tied loosely with already given income approximations.

Also, if this is not readily available, either through the FBI, or elsewhere, is there a way to petition them to send a copy of such information? They must have it if they have the aggregates they use.

"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a method I used to turn two cool datasets (foot traffic data &amp; election results) into a third cool dataset (neighborhood-level political affiliation estimates). [Last spring I completed a project](https://link.medium.com/Lv3O88dqjkb) exploring how foot traffic data (from SafeGraph; 100% free for academics, significant free samples for others) could be used to estimate political affiliation at a more detailed level than currently available.
SafeGraph’s data has been used widely to understand COVID-19 spread and  economic decline/growth in the US, but this was a new application.

In my opinion, the greatest value of this approach is that the resulting political affiliation estimates are at the Census Block Group (CBG) level—the same level used by the US Census—so more powerful demographic analysis of election results is possible. Of course, this extends to understanding vote accessibility/suppression.

*Note: My method did not supplement any estimates from vote-by-mail ballots, but it would certainly be feasible for a lot of counties across the US, depending how they report their election data.*",not_spam

"I am working with the shapefiles from the US Census Bureau for Colorado School Districts. In the files is a variable called ALand10 or something similar. It just spits out a number and I have no clue what the units are, and I can't seem to figure it out.

[Here are some notes](http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2010/usernotes.html) from the US Census Bureau.

Consider an example of Moffat County, CO (The School District is the same as the county for this case)  [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+moffat+county%2C+co) says the area is 4751 square miles. The data from the shapefile says the area for that district is 1,494,753,340 (no units specified).

I know I could just use a conversion factor, but for the paper I am working on, as well as for the sake of robustness, I would like to know what the units of measure from the shapefiles is. (Edit: The conversion factor would only work if its a linear relationship)

Thanks!

"Hello,

 What's Flat Data?

&gt; Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. 
&gt; It builds on the ""git scraping"" approach pioneered by Simon Willison 
&gt; to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories 
&gt; and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and 
&gt; easier than working with data over the wire.
&gt;
&gt; (Source: [Flata Data - GitHub Office of the CTO](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data)) 


  For a long running real-world example following the flat data ""git scraping"" approach
  even before Simon Willison pioneered the approach 
  allow me to highlight the [/factbook.json](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.json) datasets.

  The 260 country profile datasets get auto-updated twice a month (on the 1st and 15th)
  via the [/factbook](https://github.com/factbook/factbook) scripts
 for easy (re)use and offline world data exploration.

"Every week or so for about the last two months I keep seeing requests about how to get median income for zip codes in the U.S.  Below is a quick and dirty guide, followed by links to official training webinars on [census.gov](https://census.gov) and then a website on why you shouldn't use zip codes as a geography.

How to get the data:

1. Go to [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov).
2. In the ""I'm looking for..."" search bar, type in ""median income""
3. A quick answer in a box pops up. Underneath that, it says ""tables"". Click on the text that says ""Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars)"". This takes you to a table with an income distribution and mean and median income.
4. On the upper rightish corner there will be the year. It will say something like ""2018: ACS 1-year estimates"". Click on this and select the 5-year estimates. You can select years for past data as well. Zip codes aren't available for 1-year data, though. 2018 is the most current year available as the time that I am writing this.  As a side note, you can find the release dates here:  [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases.html](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases.html) 
5. To the right of that click on ""Customize Data"". This pops up a ribbon. Click on ""Geographies"".
6. Click on the toggle thingy at the top of the menu under ""Geography"" to show summary levels. After it shows a 3-digit number before each geography (e.g. 010-nation), scroll a ways down to where it says ""860 - 5-digit ZCTA"". Click on this. A side bar opens up. You can select all Zip Codes in the US or specific ones. At the top, if you click on the title by the magnifying glass, you can search for a zip code. Just be sure to start it the same was as they are listed. It looks like you have to type ""ZCTA5"" and then a space and then the zip code. As a note, ZCTA is Census-speak for ""Zip Code Tabulation Area"".
7. Once you chosen a few, hit close, and BOOM! you're data shows up. If you choose all Zip Codes, it won't display as there are too many. But you can download them.

Now, there are a bunch of training videos to help you out.  One link is the Census Academy:  [https://www.census.gov/data/academy/topics/data-tools.html](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/topics/data-tools.html).

There are also webinars:  [https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars.html](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars.html) 

Instead of using [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov), the Census also has an API.  The landing page is here:  [https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html).  

There is also a webinar on how to use the API:   [https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2019/api-acs.html](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2019/api-acs.html).

You might want to find something besides median income.  There are a lot of different tables and data products.  Here is one way to find tables:   [https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/)

"Earlier this week, [u/EricW\_CS](https://www.reddit.com/user/EricW_CS/) posted about his [US Supreme Court transcript dataset](https://github.com/EricWiener/supreme-court-cases). 

I took the liberty of importing it into [Dolt](https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt) which is a SQL database with Git Semantics. It's on DoltHub for everyone to use:

https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/us-supreme-court-cases

I did a little bit of cleaning in the process or importing it. It's a very cool dataset to run SQL on. Famous quote by Sandra Day O'Connor:

My original idea was to collect data on myself and my own amazon echo, which I wrote a script to extract from the amazon website. However, I would like to have a proper data set, especially as it would make evaluating easier

When looking for a data-set on this, I did not find anything on that format, as such, I was wondering if anyone has a good reference to where I can find that data. Ideally, it should be anonymized, and contain the metadata + the message of the voice command, or the audio file

"I'm just starting out with working with datasets and could use a little guidance setting this one up. I'm trying to download this dataset here so I can do some basic analysis practice using python on it:

For example instead of ""Chromium Dissolved as Cr (µg/L)"", it says P01030. I'm assuming this has something to do with the µ character when downloading the CSV, but I'm not sure the best way around it. I figure CSV isn't the best type of file for this type of mapping data, but I'm not sure the best way to go from here. I can't downloaded it from arcGIS website either without an account which I'd rather not pay for. Is there a way to format it after you have downloaded it to reassign the attribute definitions? Or is that kind of lost in the download? Is the fastest way to just manually type them in? Thanks for the help",not_spam

 Hello everyone! I have a question regarding the set up of my data-set and I just stumbled upon this subreddit and if there is any place to ask this question... it has to be here!

I have not been fortunate enough to locate info/resources on how my actual data-set should be set up within excel before I pull it into SAS to do the analysis....

"Hi, I located a dataset called ""World Flora Online"" that describes all the characteristics of all known plants in the world. This is EXACTLY what I need but I was disappointed to find that it doesn't seem to include pictures of each plant. Perhaps I'm wrong? Even so, I would presume that there would only be a single image and what I really need is a ImageNet like dataset where there are several hundred or preferably several thousand images for each plant for use in AI training.

Now in regards to trees and shrubs, I've yet to locate a equally comprehensive dataset that provides a flora describing all of the characteristics of each individual tree and shrubs that's currently known to exist. The closest thing I've been able to locate so far is a list of 60,000+ trees from the Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) but they do not advertise it as being a compilation of all known tree species so I'm presuming it's not and once again, I do not believe they provide any accompanying images since I was only able to locate a CSV document. As far as shrubs, I haven't been able to locate any sort of flora list or images at all.

What I need:

1. Extensive Image Dataset for All Known Plant Species with Hundreds of Images of Each Plant
2. A Complete Flora List of All Known Tree Species with Hundreds of Images of Each Tree as Well
3. A Complete Flora List and Image Dataset of All Known Shrubs

"Hello everyone, I am a university researcher with background in cognitive science working on semantic distance between words.

I come to you after having spent multiple days trying to figure out how to use the Common Crawl database implemented through word2vec using Gensim. I have basic familiarity with computers and java programming but I have never used GitHub or tools like word2vec, which takes a database of text (such as googleNews, or Wikipedia, or CommonCrawl which is GB of text data from the internet) and can give you the cosine semantic distance between 2 words.

For example ""man"" and ""woman"" might have a coefficient of 0.8 but ""water"" and ""jealousy"" might have a coefficient of 0.15 because they are rarely used in the same context.

Has anyone successfully used word2vec on their Mac? I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it work. From what I understand these are the steps I need to take, some of which I already have:

1. Install Python

This I did

2) Install Pip

This I did by running the following in my terminal:

$ Sudo easy\_install pip

$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setup tools wheel

3) Install Gensim

This I did by running the following in my terminal:

$ pip install --upgrade gensim

4) Install Word2vec and train it on Common Crawl as its corpus

"This is directly related to the recent case that I'm sure you all have been hearing about. I've gotten in a fierce debate about whether it is appropriate to assume someone that the murder of a witness in a high profile case like this one, two days after the trial, is more likely to be due to retaliation or other trial-related motivations, or if it's more likely that it's just a random murder not related to the trial that coincidentally happens right after the trial. I'm the one who thinks it's more likely than not that such a murder 2 days after a trial is related to the trial  


In order to prove this, need to get a set of data points of all witnesses who have been murdered within lets say a year after a trial.

"Hello everyone,

Please let me know if this is the wrong place to post this kind of stuff.

Edit: If you'd like an update when/if we publish the dataset or some models using it, please let me know :)

This is a simple data collection app that, after you have provided some ratings, gives you some movie recommendations for you to watch later. You can try it out here: [https://mindreader.tech/](https://mindreader.tech/).

The difference between this one and datasets like MovieLens is that here we are asking you about actors, genres, directors, subjects, etc. as well.

We're working on my specialization within cold-start recommender systems, specifically interview-based systems that try to ask users what they think about certain items in order to generate a good initial profile for them.

Most interview systems ask towards items during this interview. In a movie-recommending setting, this means that you would be asked if you like certain movies. It of course makes much more sense to ask the user whether they like horror movies, comedy movies, etc. first before delving into more specific topics. However, no dataset with this feedback explicitly stated exists.

That is what this little game is for.

From the little feedback we have received so far, it looks like our hypothesis holds true. Users answer ""Don't know"" to movies much more often than they do for non-movie entities. If you are interested, we return all our statistics of the dataset at [https://mindreader.tech/api/statistics](https://mindreader.tech/api/statistics) so you can have a look yourself.

I hope you want to try it out - if nothing else, you are aiding research and getting some recommendations out of it ;)",not_spam

"Unfortunately, I am not the most computer savvy person, and honestly, wouldn't even know the correct metric to measure internet usage in general, let alone on a state by state basis, so I do not have any relevant data to contribute.

I am in the process of writing to my State Senator regarding Net Neutrality Legislation in California. I want my proposal to be as thorough as possible. I may not understand the finer points of net usage, but I do understand the general dread over throttling and increased ""tiered"" fees. I also know, from a lifetime of experience, that Telecoms will do whatever is absolutely worst for their customers at all times.

I am trying to show my Senator that California accounts for X% of all internet traffic in the United States. Considering we account for roughly 8.5% of the nation's population, I'd imagine we also account for a similarly large slice of all nationwide traffic/usage.

Similar to the way California's passage of increased gas mileage legislation basically forced car manufacturers to meet our standards or lose the largest auto market in the US, I am hoping that if we enact state NN legislation, we could force Telecoms to fall in line or lose the largest market in the country.

Once California falls... My hope is that other states will fall like dominoes with similar legislation.

Anyway... I am hoping someone with a better grip on the actual figures needed - showing how much internet traffic/usage California accounts for - can help me out with some good data representation.

"As I mentioned in a previous post, starting in 2018, I will be making daily submission and comment dumps available.  As an example of what is to come, I am creating daily files for October and November so that you can begin using them in scripts, etc.

The location for the daily files is https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/daily

The entire month of October is available now in that folder (one file per day).  The file name is RCS_YYYY-MM-DD.tar.xz

The files are highly compressed using xz with the -9e (extreme) setting.  They take longer to create, but it is well worth the increased compression time due to the high compression ratio (close to 90% compression).  Each day is between 250-350 megabytes.

There are two files inside each tar file.  There is a comment dump (RC) and a submission dump (RS) within each file.  

If you are interested in testing out scripts or just want to play around with some data analysis, just one of these files will provide you with over 2 million comments and hundreds of thousands of submissions.

Let me know if you have any questions and/or suggestions.  If you have already downloaded the October monthly submission and comment dumps, then you already have the data that is contained in these files.  

For those of you who could not handle the large monthly dumps, these daily files will give you a chance to play around with the data.

________________________________


To get started immediately, here is a link to the October 31 (Halloween) file: https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/daily/RCS_2017-10-31.tar.xz (~ 344 megabytes compressed).  The uncompressed file sizes are:

RS_2017-10-31 796,500,058 bytes

RC_2017-10-31 1,918,526,219 bytes  (~2.8 gigabytes of data compressed down to ~344 megabytes)

**Hint: (Examples below assume you are using Ubuntu or some other Debian flavored OS)**

You do *NOT* have to uncompress the files to use the data.  You can stream straight from the tarball if you are low on space.  

Here's how to stream the comments to standard output:

    tar -xOf RCS_2017-10-31.tar.xz 'RC_2017-10-31'

This will stream the submissions to standard output:

    tar -xOf RCS_2017-10-31.tar.xz 'RS_2017-10-31'

If you install jq (apt install jq), you can easily view just the comment bodies directly to standard output.

Here is how to view the first 10 comments without having to uncompress first:

    tar -xOf RCS_2017-10-31.tar.xz 'RC_2017-10-31' | head -n10 | jq '.body'

You can also extract only comments matching a certain subreddit directly to STDOUT:

    tar -xOf RCS_2017-10-31.tar.xz 'RC_2017-10-31' | jq 'select(.subreddit | match(""askreddit"";""i""))'

This would extract all comments from /r/politics and send it straight to a compressed file without the need to uncompress the file:

    tar -xOf RCS_2017-10-31.tar.xz 'RC_2017-10-31' | jq -cM 'select(.subreddit | match(""politics"";""i""))' | gzip -9 &gt; politics.gz

Output only comments with a score greater than 100 and have been gilded:

    tar -xOf RCS_2017-11-11.tar.xz 'RC_2017-11-11' | jq -cM 'select(.score &gt; 100 and .gilded &gt; 0)'

All publicly available comments and submissions made on that day (UTC) are contained in the tarball.

I am a statistics major in my senior year of college looking for a data set I can base my next project on.  Specifically, I am looking for a data set pertaining to ecommerce for which I can run a logistic regression on.

I was thinking that the response variable (which duh...needs to be binary) would be something like whether or not the customer bought anything (1 if yes; else 0).  Predictors could be the amount of time spent on the page, number of clicks, visits per week, number of ads on page, etc., etc.

Ideally the data set would have at least 1000 rows and not be a *complete* nightmare to clean up...though some cleaning is always expected.  

I've seen a few sets on kaggle already, but none of them seem to be appropriate for a logistic regression. Any thoughts?

Thank you in advance!",not_spam

Granted, Wiki has this information, albeit in a rather unstructured way, meaning they have paragraphs  under a heading, which may or may not exist for another destination.

"This dataset is meant for anyone who would like to try to create a deep learning agent either using supervised or (offline) reinforcement learning to play League of Legends. The dataset contains 72 games from patch 11.21 (last patch) where the game ended in an early surrender. These games were chosen as the game lengths were guaranteed to be low which kept the dataset from being too large.
To download the dataset, go to [this](https://github.com/MiscellaneousStuff/tlol) GitHub link and click on the `Google Drive Link`. The dataset is stored as an SQLite database file and the schema should be relatively self-explanatory. Happy to answer any questions.

This is just a preliminary dataset which demonstrates that this is possible. Within the next few days the dataset will contain 1000s of replays which means 10,000s of champions worth of data (for each time a player plays a champion).

Edit: Database now contains all 191 early surrender games (games ending at or before 3.5 minutes) in the dataset.
This table shows the top 10 champion occurrences within the dataset.

| Champion     | No. |
| ------------ | --- |
| Nami         | 116 |
| Miss Fortune | 103 |
| Lucian       | 61  |
| Khazix       | 36  |
| Viego        | 35  |
| Lux          | 34  |
| Jhin         | 32  |
| Yone         | 30  |
| Camille      | 29  |
| Graves       | 29  |

Edit 2: Larger dataset containing 987 games targeting Miss Fortune in the early game (up to first 5 minutes) with the same schema and format as the first dataset. Also contains all game objects recorded 4 times a second. The games were chosen by getting the games where the MF player lived the longest. This gave a dataset where the players overall had a 64.4% win rate in roughly EUW Diamond II.

Edit 3: A further 728 games also targeting Miss Fortune in the early game (up to first 5 minutes) with the same schema and format as the first and second dataset. This brings the total number of games for the MF-Longevity datasets to 1,715 or
`1,715 games * (5 minutes * 60 seconds * 4 frames/second) := 2,058,000 frames in total.`
This should now be enough to at least create a deep learning agent which can play Miss Fortune for the first five minutes of a game at least to a basic level.

Edit 4: Another day another dataset. A further 773 games from the `MFLongevity` dataset have been uploaded. I have now also included a Jupyter Notebook to analyse the data from the `191-EarlyFF` dataset which works completely standalone from Google Colab. Feel free to also run it locally if you wish to.

"Hello,

I am taking a graduate level course on applied machine learning. The goal of the course is not to have a rigorous understanding of the mathematics behind ML algorithms, but to develop an intuitive sense for how to handle data and use it for an end-to-end ML project.

To this end, we are required to do a class project with a fairly rich (a good amount of features which I can later engineer) and large dataset. Pretty much the only requirement for the dataset is that it needs to have at least 1000 instance. While that seems like a small number, my professor has insisted that something like 1000 entries from time series data will not cut it. Instead, it has to be at least 1000 uniquely identifiable instances.

My background is in materials science and nanotechnology, but I cannot find any interesting datasets for the same which meets the above requirement. It would be great if someone could share ideas for some datasets I can look into. PLEASE NOTE that I am not very picky about what domain the dataset is from. My only request is that it is not a toy dataset (like MNIST or Titanic Survival), but it should be something that has interesting applications if I choose to work on it.

So far I have been looking at the UCI repository and Kaggle and I am drawn towards human activity recognition or text classification (sentiment analysis and author attribution), but I am open to any suggestion ya'll have. ",not_spam

"Synesthesia. What is synesthesia? According to google, ""Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense (for example, hearing) is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, color or flavor.""

One of the types of synesthesia, one of the most common, is Grapheme-Colour synesthesia, where, as defined earlier, is where people associate things such as numbers, dates, letters, and many more, with colours. For instance, to me, the number five is a very bright orange, and the month of March is a deep green. This form is NOT only for people with synesthesia. You can submit to it whether you have synesthesia or not, just please submit to it seriously, with what you feel represents it best.  
Other things to note:  
\-Submitting for the months is mandatory, the weekdays and the numbers are not.  
\-The form will close on January 18   
\-My goal is 200 submissions. If anyone could somehow give this survey to others that would be greatly appreciated!

"&gt;Electrophysiological data from implanted electrodes in the human brain are rare, and therefore scientific access to such data has remained somewhat exclusive. Here we present a freely available curated library of implanted electrocorticographic data and analyses for 16 behavioural experiments, with 204 individual datasets from 34 patients recorded with the same amplifiers and at the same settings. For each dataset, electrode positions were carefully registered to brain anatomy. A large set of fully annotated analysis scripts with which to interpret these data is embedded in the library alongside them. All data, anatomical locations and analysis files (MATLAB code) are provided in a shared file structure at

In Germany there are laws requiring individual gas stations to report prices (even intraday price changes) to a central database. I think there are even smartphone apps built on those data to inform drivers of the cheapest station near them.

"I'm studying the 2001 paper ""Inhomogeneous scaling behaviors in Malaysian foreign currency exchange rates"" by Muniandy et al, where the authors analyze daily foreign currency exchange rates, in particular 

&gt; In this paper, we first examine the empirical scaling behaviors of the foreign currency exchange rates, namely the US dollar (USD), Japanese yen (YEN) and Singapore dollar (SGD) with respect to Malaysia’s currency Ringgit Malaysia (RM) as shown in Fig. 1. These time series are the daily trading excluding weekends and holidays for the duration between 2nd April 1985 and 30th April 2001.

(note: today the abbreviation MYR is used instead of RM)  
I have to study the article and repeat the experiments, however I cannot find the data they used.

I tried using the python package yfinance with the command

    yf.download(tickers='MYRUSD=X', actions=True, threads=False, start='1985-04-02')

but it download data starting from 2003, so I guess older data are not available on yahoo finance.

I tried dozen of sites without success. The best I found is investing dot com which has daily rates MYR/JPY from 1989, MYR/SGD from 1990, but MYR/USD only from 2004.

Somebody knows a source with older data?",not_spam

"I [scraped a lot of election data from Politico a few days ago], and a kind reader discovered that Politico's third-party candidates had a lot of errors in their indicated party affiliation (Green called Democratic, etc.). So I rescraped the whole thing without identifying individual third parties (the Democrats and Republicans had no false negatives) and looked for a site that could give me the party affliations for small parties I could merge back in.

Lo and behold, the New York Times embeds its election data as a JSON blob in the page source, so that was easy. As a bonus, they also include things like state legislatures and other more local offices that Politico's results didn't have. They don't drill down to the county level, however, so I couldn't have used them to begin with.

I quickly scraped all the JSON blobs and put them into one JSON file with the state name as key.

I'll parse and merge some more after work today, but meanwhile, I thought some might find this useful:

"Hi, As said in the title, I'm trying to make a list of countries by ""English speaking internet users"".

Two separate Wikipedia pages list the two statistics:

[List of countries by English-speaking population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population).

[List of Internet users by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_users_by_country).

This is almost what I want:

[Internet users by language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage#Internet_users_by_language)

But this only shows the amount of users of each language, not where they're from.

I want:

""List of countries by English speaking internet users""

---

Reason for the data? Countries have borders. But the internet is an international phenomenon. The main borders are language borders, with crossings in multi-lingual people, and tourists in internet translators.

It's pretty clear based on the data I do have access to (above data separately), that English Speaking Americans are the majority of internet users. They have over twice as many English speakers as second place India, and over twice as many internet users regardless of language.

This shows that the United States has the largest influence on the English speaking internet (obvious to most).

And this is the goal, looking at the influence different countries have on the English Internet.

---

India, it has the second highest amount of English speakers, and fourth highest on the amount of Internet users (hold your jokes please). Though the majority of their English speakers have it as an additional language, so that's probably why we see more British influence on the internet than Indian.

"Hey everyone,

I (along with 2 other people) made a project called **Newsemble**.  It is an API that allows for fast retrieval of current news (at the moment, only Indian websites are supported, but we can add others if anyone wants that). It's a REST API built using *Flask, MongoDB and BeautifulSoup*.  Due to some of the drawbacks of current news APIs (full content not available, character limit, limited requests), we wanted to build our own as were looking to do news analysis.

We have made all the code open source. Please refer to the [medium blog](https://medium.com/@rg089/newsemble-3311d2dc9817) for further details and implementation of this API.

*This will be useful for news analysis, trend detection, keyword detection amongst other NLP tasks.*

*We are planning to release some NLP projects using this API very soon!*

***Most importantly, if there are any additional features or extra news sites you want, or any other improvements in general, please do let us know. Thanks!🤝🏻***

**Additionally, we are storing all the data and will release a complete dataset soon!**

If you found the project useful, please 👏 the article or 🌟 the repo. It really motivates us going forward!

"Hey I've been building an open COVID-19 case data pipeline: [https://github.com/covid19-data/covid19-data](https://github.com/covid19-data/covid19-data)

Originally, I was using [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for my visualization initially, but the dataset contains too many inconsistencies (e.g. sudden changes in country names and aggregation level) and they are not being addressed: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues)

So, I'm working on an alternative data pipeline where everything is transparent. It currently merges

1. WHO daily case data (cleaned by Our World in Data team)
2. Wikipedia US case data
3. Worldbank country metadata
4. ISO 3166-2 Alpha-3 codes from Wikipedia

And uses Tableau's version of the JHU CSSE dataset to extract coordinates (plan to switch to another dataset because of so many errors and inconsistencies). The whole pipeline is automatic (using Python and Snakemake) and everything is indexed by the ISO 3166-2 Alpha-3 codes.

For instance, [https://github.com/covid19-data/covid19-data/blob/master/output/cases/cases\_WHO\_WP.csv](https://github.com/covid19-data/covid19-data/blob/master/output/cases/cases_WHO_WP.csv) is the cleaned country-level case data indexed by 3 letter codes. 

I feel like so much effort is currently being wasted at [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr) because they are just ignored.

Hope to redirect some of these efforts to build a nice open data pipeline! Thanks!",not_spam

"Hello all,

I have a week off and wanted to do a quick RPA project, mostly for the COVID-19 pandemic, but can be for anything. If anyone needs a specific dataset that needs to be scraped, gathered, or organized in some fashion, comment it below!

&amp;#x200B;

**Update:** So I did some research today and concluded that I will attempt to do 2 of the most requested datasets this week, time permitting and prioritized as follows.

1. Coronavirus daily cases count per country, updated daily. Might upload to a GitHub for it unless we have another suggestion for that.
2. Instead a strict data set for someone yawning for example, Im going to be looking into building a solution that can easily mine data of whatever type of picture using google images. While this may lead to some junk in the data, I believe the dynamic / generic value of the bot will be greater. I can distribute a how-to-guide on using the bot, and ways to improve the data it mines. If anyone has any other suggestions, please feel free to comment.

If either of these fall through, I will be working on a dataset for the environmental or social factors to compare the impacts of covid. Thanks for all of the awesome ideas! I will look to post the links here.

Also thanks for the award!

**Update 2:** I have mostly been working on the generic solution to data mining desired pictures, however I also created this repo with the initial upload of COVID-19 cases. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. I will be working on a way to collect older daily data, though I plan on updating this every night at 9PM EST, which will represent that current day's case count.

That can be found here:  [https://github.com/Ryzen120/COVID-19\_Daily\_Cases](https://github.com/Ryzen120/COVID-19_Daily_Cases)

**Update 3:** Discontinuing my daily case project, as I found this.

Example: i want household and buildings in Iceland, so I will pick Iceland then check only household and buildings checkboxes, and the price will update accordingly.

\-They provide sample data ( I got sample data from a region in Iceland, I just cant find the file anymore)

I hope somebody could help me find the website. Been searching for hours, and I really need it.

If I really cannot find it, perhaps other cheap source of somewhat reliable dataset would definitely help.

"Hello all,

Last year I worked on a grad school project, analyzing tweets regarding Amazon's HQ2 location. We collected tweets from late September 2018 (project start) until the official location decision announcement.

The purpose of this project was to determine if sentiment regarding HQ2 cities (as determined via Twitter) could be used to predict which city Amazon would select. Additionally, we found housing price data in each of the 20 finalist cities; our goal was to explore whether sentiment regarding HQ2 was correlated with an increase in housing prices.

At the attached GitHub link, you will find my .py file using twitter API to collect tweets and store them in a MySQL database, hosted on Python Anywhere. (Really good skill to have, review the code if interested.) A jupyter notebook contains code for our analysis. Additionally, a corpus of tweets regarding HQ2 (separate from training data) has been uploaded, where tweets were tagged as positive or negative sentiment.

Lastly, (and likely of most interest to everyone) a .csv file with 2300+ tweets regarding HQ2 and various finalist cities has been uploaded.

I hope this dataset is useful to you; it certainly was a fun and rewarding project for me.

"I am trying to decide if it is worthwhile collecting a dataset? I am a developer who can (legally) collect users sites visited, amount of time on site, sex, age, location ( &amp; timezone), and sites categorized into approx. 80 different categories (such as automotive, online shopping, porn, etc). I estimate it would be between 5,000 - 20,000  unique users at peak per month. (It could grow, but it would cost me more money).  


I myself am not a data scientist, so I personally have no use for the data (although my application does for non-commercial use, hence it is collected but not necessarily stored). However, running servers for API calls, database storage and the management of it takes time and money. Ideally I would love to be able to find a buyer for the anonymous data to continue to pay for the service I offer (which is free).

Is it really worth saving users browsing data these days?",not_spam

"How does someone quire info on a particular companies sales for particular items they sell? Example: How many work gloves are sold by mechanix (a glove company) annually? 

I know this is an odd thing to ask but i cant seem to find this information on the internet for some reason but i know reddit has more research skillzz than i ever will. 

Anyway here is a bit of my back story which explains why i need this info, if anyone cares.

I'm a 23 year old kid from NH who was presented with an idea for a new product a few years back by a friend. I honestly believe this product has a lot of potential so I proposed we create a company based around this product and file a provisional patent. Fast forward to now we have successfully created and an LLC and still hold the  provisional patent rights to the product, i know it took a little while but we did it right and have only invested a few grand so far. I am currently in contact with multiple companies that are providing me quotes for design as well as manufacturing costs. One thing these companies need from me is a ROM or Rough Order Magnitude(at least the most accurate one i can come up with anyway). This now brings me to my current dilemma, i know the questions i need answered but dont know if these answers are available to the public.

Such questions include: 
how many work gloves did certain companies sell annually.
How many hard hats sold in us annually.
How many high visibility vests were sold annually.
Things like that..

"Hi, I hope I'm in the right subreddit, if not I'd be thankful for any advice where to go next :D Sorry if my english is bad, it's not my first language.
I'm currently writing my Masters in Geology and had a bit of a fuck up regarding my data. I lost all of the weather data from the Taza region of Morocco. I don't know how, but now it's gone. The problem is I can't seem to find the data online since I don't know where to look. It was from november 2009 to august 2012 and I got it ages ago from another student who no longer has a copy. 
Now to my question. Where can i find over 10 year old datasets of hourly air temperature and either hourly dew point or relative humidity. 
Thank you in advance for any help I get


Edit: Thank all of you so much for helping me with all of your advices! I'm still figuring some of those websites out and sifting through them but I'm confident that I'll make it and find the data I'm looking for :D

"Hello. I've been working on a project that involves using the Riot Games API to scrape various in game stats. 

The dataset contains 53452 rows of players' from matches. It was stored in a SQL database using Python then exported into CSV format. The dataset contains 65 features including winner/loser. Some of them are non-descript ordinal which you can remove and there are a few more that do not pertain to solo queue match stats(dominion stats that do not get tracked). 

I plan to upload the dataset with 44 features in the near future. The github should also contain teamstats dataset which are team objective stats recorded from the same games.

All matches are after 9-21-2015 which is a day after a certain patch. Can't remember off the top of my head. 

Let me know if you have any questions. Dataset is released under MIT license. 
I have done various work on this including knn, logistic regression, correlation/covariance analysis, and some other feature selection techniques. The final report should be completed in two weeks so I will be uploading that to my github as well. Have a great day everyone.

So far I have done 12 gigs, and I have no plans to stop. During edinburgh festival my goal is to do at least 30 gigs, by the end of the year i should have done at least 60. For a few gigs now I have been writing myself a little ""post gig"" note to remind myself of how it went. After my 12th gig today I had the idea to start collecting some hard data. I think once I've done a large number of gigs (like over 100) there should be some interesting trends and things to look at.        
      
Here are the things I am planning to log so far (and have entered for the gigs I've done already, where I can remember)

Date        
Gig Name       
Venue Name    
Area   
Day of Week     
MC Name         
Number of acts       
Number of female acts (incl me &amp; mc &amp; headliner if appropriate)     
Number of audience members (if under 10 this is exact, over 10 is an approx)         
Number of female audience members (if under 10 this is exact, over 10 is an approx)          
Number of people I brought         
Who, if any, was the named headliner?    
Start time (of whole evening)      
End time (of whole evening)           
Time arrived home            
Minutes Performed           
Jokes totally fluffed         
Intended bits accidentally omitted      
Number of heckles (so far always zero!)  
Score I'd give myself out of 10 where: 10 = Absolute comedy genius &amp; 0 = Dying on arse           
Score I'd give myself out of 10 where: 10 = Best I've done so far &amp; 0 = Worst I've done so far          
Score I'd give myself out of 10 where: 10 = Best of the acts present &amp; 0 = Worst of the acts present          
Out of 10: Nerves in hour beforehand           

Things I am considering logging that will require a lot more effort (listening back to the audio and counting):             
Number of jokes/moments I hoped for laughs        
Number of laughs (any kind)         
Number of small laughs         
Number of medium laughs         
Number of huge laughs

I am currently having an interesting idea for my bachelor's degree final project. I want to conduct sentiment analysis to text in order to detect hate speech (in any form of it) and then continue the analysis with community detection from the background graph structure for the data set.

For example, the data set would need to have tweets for all users individually, and moreover, to have graph information for links between users, for example which users a given user follows (in a given edge list perhaps).

Can anyone suggest a multimodal dataset that can satisfy these requirements?

Suggestions on best ways to tackle this?

- pivot table - not sure how that would help. If you put the row labels/y axis as company names, values on the x axis, you can sort by largest to smallest for each month but that change would 'disappear' doing it for each month so you wouldnt be able to track anything

– Dataset of all country/polity surface area, or even of country borders over time, from which I can calculate the areas

So I saw quite a few posts since the election on social media showing how vote counts sometimes decrease and how that means that there was fraud. I hate all the disinformation spreading around but could not find a completely waterproof answer to disprove it - the most satisfying answer I could come up with is that nobody would be so stupid and alter voting totals after they’ve been reported. Consequently, it must be an error and I wanted to investigate where this error comes from - my instinct is typos on a county level probably but I wanted to look further into it.

I saw that the feed comes from the Associated Press, but it seems that the recordings of this data are not publicly accessible. Has any organization made a recording of it by any chance? Or states that published it themselves?

"My Morse Learning Machine Challenge was approved by Kaggle last night. For details [click here](http://ag1le.blogspot.com/2014/09/morse-learning-machine-challenge.html)

The goal of this competition is to build a machine that learns how to decode audio files containing Morse code. I hope to attract people from the [Kaggle community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle) who are interested in solving new, difficult challenges using their predictive data modeling, computer science and machine learning expertise.
During the competition, the participants build a learning system capable of decoding Morse code. To that end, they get development data consisting of 200 .WAV audio files containing short sequences of randomized Morse code. The data labels are provided for a training set so the participants can self-evaluate their systems. To evaluate their progress and compare themselves with others, they can submit their prediction results on-line to get immediate feedback. A real-time Kaggle leaderboard shows participants their current standing based on their validation set predictions.

I have also provided sample Python Morse decoder to make it easier to get started. While this software is purely experimental version it has some features of the FLDIGI Morse decoder but implemented using Python instead of C++.
Please help me to spread this message to attract participants for the Morse Learning Machine challenge!

"I'm having a particularly tough time finding an open dataset for movies that has the plot/synopsis/summary for a film and the primary genre to which it belongs (I used to work at Blockbuster back in the early-90s, would the rule was every film could only be categorized to a single genre, and the MPAA rating for the film (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17). I'm attempting to do a machine learning project whereby a film's description (which is carefully-crafted marketing fluff) and genre can be used to predict its rating.

I just joined this thread and saw a lot of questions like 'is there any dataset XXX with specific condition YYY (i.,e past 20 years, specific region KKK, etc) here.

just wondering if there is any dataset trading market? if not, why yet? (may be too rough question).

I know there are a lot of publicly available datasets provided by big tech companies, governments and research labs, but these datasets mostly for general cases and I guess there are/will be a lot of dataset demands for edge cases as AI industry is getting specific. For example, if I need tennis swing coach machine learning trading data from swing/serve data today, I am not sure that is something easily accessible.

What if there is such platform enabling person or companies to trade the data set with fancy dataset filters? would there be a lot of needs? the platform can provide well-organized filters/download/upload toolsets as a middle man.

Is selling public data illegal? like If I sell a dataset from Google lab or U.S national lab to someone else and get money, would that behavior be illegal? or is there any license thing on dataset like open source ?",not_spam

"Hello everyone!

I have been cycling for about a year now, and am currently looking at upgrading to a true road cycling bike. Although, I  have noticed that there seems to be a large variety to choose from and a large price variance between bikes that seem to have similar mechanics. I am still doing research, but it seems like there are a few main things to look at when comparing models: type of frame, what groupset they have, gearing, wheels, and crank set. 

So, I am wondering if anyone has any leads on a data sets that includes different models of road bikes ( maby like 2018 or 2019 to 2020 models?), their price point, and different mechanics they have - such as what type of gearing, wheels, crankset, etc, so I can do an analysis and compare all of my options at once. 

Thanks!

TLDR:   looking for data set that has price, road bike model, and list of main components so I can compare several options at once.",not_spam

I've got an application that analyzes a user-submitted license plate and attempts to validate whether it's in a proper format.  I do this with a dataset containing possible regex combinations.  

For example, the state of Alabama may have plates in a format of:

    [0-9][A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4}
    [0-9]{2}[A-Z][0-9]{4}
    [0-9]{4}[A-Z]{2}[0-9]

Arizona might have plates in the format of

    [0-9]{2}[A-Z]
    [0-9]{2}[A-Z]{2}
    [0-9]{4}

"Hi everyone!
I'm going to work on a project that should be able to detect tendencies of chronic stress via text messages with NLP. To do that, I need a dataset which consists of results from any stress scale that helps to measure chronic stress (for example: Perceived Stress Scale) and any text-based input (preferably in english) from the observations/persons. Unfortunately, I do have problems to find any dataset that includes this specific information. Does anybody know of a dataset that would fit this description? Or does have anybody a hint where I could find such a dataset?

I would appreciate any input :)",not_spam
"Results: https://easyupload.io/e7l57l

So the Five Factor Mindfulness Scale is divided up between:

* Observe

* Describe

* Act with Awareness

* Nonjudge

* Nonreact

And I've measured the five factors combined into ""Mindfulness"" as well.

So I mostly put out this questionnaire to get an idea of internal validity. The Five Facets are fairly distinct from each other, except that it seems that Nonreactive people tend to also be Nonjudging.

A few of these questions are really weak. As an example, ""I am easily distracted"" only has four correlations greater than 30%, and only one greater than 40%: ""When I do things, my mind wanders off and I'm easily distracted.""--which is a similarly weak question. There definitely doesn't seem to be any reason to keep both questions.

It's possible that this 39 item questionnaire could be shortened significantly without any real loss. I'll be using a shortened version in the future.",not_spam

"If you live in the academic ecosystem, you know that publication in your fields top tier journals is increasingly the only thing that matters for hiring, promotion, and tenure. If that's the game, we thought it would be interesting to know the standings. We recently undertook a project to identify all top tier journal publications in each academic field and self publish the data. We recently completed this for economics and are wrapping up marketing and management. Please let us know in the comments if there is a field you would like to see summarized.


We recently completed our analysis of top tier economics journal publications from 2014 to 2017. By collecting author, work affiliation, and graduate programs authors graduated from information, we were able to summarize the number of top tier publication for each economist, each department, and the amount of research published by alumni for each economics Ph.D. Program. We found that 1,323 economists published in top tier economics journals during this period.


Best Economists

Professor Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Xavier Gabiax of Harvard University with five (5) publications each. Only 172 economists published two or more articles, and only 39 published three or more. Publishing 4 or more landed you in the top most productive economists from 2014 to 2017.

Best Departments

We found that Harvard University (77 publications), University of Chicago (70), and MIT (60) had the most research productive economics faculty. Faculty from only 324 departments, centers, companies, or government agencies published in top tier journals. Only 29 had more than 10 articles published.

PhD Programs

We found that Harvard (179 publications), MIT (122), and Princeton (67) had the most productive alumni. All authors graduated from one of only 168 economics PhD programs and only 20 PhD programs had alumni with 10 or more articles published. Interestingly, alumni from the University of Rochester were the 10th most productive with 30 published articles. 


We summarized these findings in three datasets and provided the individual publication data as well as data collection methodology and results available [here](https://www.dataandsons.com/data-market/social-sciences/best-economists-departments-and-phd-programs-2018).

"Hey guys,

I'm one of the founders of ParseHub - www.parsehub.com - a visual data extraction tool. We really want to make the world of data accessible to anyone within a few clicks. ParseHub was primarily built to handle javascript and dynamic websites, where getting data from logins, tables, dropdowns, search, pagination, forms, etc. is not a problem.

It would be great if anyone can share their experience with web scraping and checkout out ParseHub for user feedback.

What challenges or hassles did you encounter with web scraping or other methods or data collection?

Have you tried any data extraction tools?

What purpose did you need a large set of data from the web for in the past?

Again, would love to hear your feedback good or bad. Please reach out at angelina@parsehub.com if you want to chat!

"I am looking at these CDC data sets for deaths in the US that are linked below. However, I was wondering if anyone else has ever worked with this dataset and could explain something to me? Basically the numbers feel a bit high to me. For example, the number of deaths that are coded to be associated with covid is 336k rather than closer to 200k. In addition, the numbers for 'All Causes' seem to be higher than expected as well. I was trying to compare 2020 to other years, so was adding up deaths by All Causes for January- August of each year. However that number seemed to be above 3 million for most years even for that 8 month period, when my understanding was that in general more like 2.5 million people die each year. 

Any ideas of what I might be misunderstanding or how I should filter the data more appropriately? My fear is that I'm double-counting deaths somehow. My father was wanting to understand whether deaths are being over-reported because of coronavirus and so I wanted to show that there really are more deaths this year than previous years, regardless of reported cause (sigh...). Not sure this is actually the right data set to use though. Thanks for any help you can give!

"I'm a data science student who's psyched about the great opportunities in the field. Armed with nothing but enthusiasm and gut, I've ventured into the field by taking some python data science courses on datacamp, and udemy.

¶ Numpy
¶ Matplotlib
¶ Pandas

However, I believe there's more than meet the eyes in data science field.

This is a five hour sample of the Twitter firehose (+33.3% sample rate) during the beginning of the United States / North Korea Summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.  This is a fully hydrated dataset using the ""extended_tweet"" setting to ensure the entire tweet text is preserved.  The data also includes a user object for every original tweet, retweet, quoted tweet and reply tweets.

Size (Compressed)|8,415,064,076 bytes

Number of Tweets | 21,552,423

This file represents a five hour period of the beginning of the UK/NK Summit (starting at 7:30 PM ET and extending to 12:30 AM).  There are approximately ~1,200 tweets per second and includes original tweets embedded in each retweeted object.  The probability of getting an original retweet is 50% if it was retweeted once and quickly approaches 100% after 10+ retweets.

This file contains millions of user objects with many belonging to news organizations throughout the world.  If you have ever wanted to play with a sample much larger than 1%, this file will give you a lot to analyze.

This data is for academic purposes only and cannot be used for commercial purposes.

When processing this file, keep in mind that there could be additional data (tweets) under the ""retweeted_status"" and ""quoted_status"" keys.  Every tweet object will also contain a user object as well.  

The probability of an original tweet being present in this dataset is dependent on the number of times it was retweeted.  The following chart shows the probabilities:

Has anyone a clue where I could get data about world energy consumption since the 1800s? I'd like to see how energy needs have exploded since the exploration of fossil fuels and (preferably) how the energy mix changed.

"I'm working with the FEC dataset on campaign finance. Specifically the table which shows money movement from one committee to another - [Any transaction from one committee to another file description | FEC](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/any-transaction-one-committee-another-file-description/). My problem is ensuring that I'm correctly deduplicating reciprocal entries such that I'm not counting the same money twice.

For example, here is an aggregate view for two connected committees. In line 1, the $35K is recorded as an inflow while in line 2, the same $35K is recorded again as an outflow. I only want to count the 35K once.

C00010603 -&gt; C00136200 = $35,000 (18G - Transfer in from affiliated committee)

C00136200 -&gt; C00010603 = $35,000 (24G - Transfer out from affiliated committee)

From this, I know that 18G/24G are related, but there are quite a number of codes: [Transaction type code descriptions | FEC](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/transaction-type-code-descriptions/). Some descriptions seem to provide some hints, but where possible I would like to avoid inferring these relationships and definitively identify the inflow/outflow pairs.

Is anyone aware of someone who has done this exercise already?

**Edit:**

I did do an analysis to flag any identical inverted $ amounts between two committees as possibly fitting this criteria, though it doesn't give me much understanding. The first pair for example wouldn't seem like they're connected in reading the descriptions:

18K = Contribution received from registered filer

24K = Contribution made to nonaffiliated committee

\--Top 10 pairs (Number of Pairs)--

18K-&gt;24K 25,464

18G-&gt;24G  2,388

I am trying to find a Census Block Group level data set that contains not only the number of  public transit stops in a given census block group but also how many other census block groups can be reached from a given location.

That is, I will have the time and ID of each census block that can be reached within a 45 minute public transit commute from a given starting location. This, however, seems extremely time-consuming and potentially not the most effective way to do this.

Hello
I want to build a twitter dataset for academic purpose. My focus is the anti ACTA campaign on Twitter. Therefore my initial idea was to extract all tweet with #ACTA from a certain period of time (January 2012 - July 2012). But apparently it's close to impossible to access this kind of data with the twitter API.

So another way I thought about was to select a population (MEPs, activisists) to extract their tweet with #ACTA. Would that be possible ?

Another question: I've actually received some pretty interesting results using the new Advanced Search for Twitter - where I can select the relevant field. Is there anyway to scrappe Tweets from those fields or would I have to do that manually?",not_spam

Cheers.

For a friend, and as personal project, I'm going to be hosting the Million Song Dataset and making it freely, publically accessible via a query API.

Anyone would be able to grab the entire dataset as a csv with a single API call. You'd also be able to ask for only certain columns, limit the number of rows, and do some basic filtering.

An example query:

	{
		dataset: ""million-song-dataset"",
		columns: [
			""song id"",
			""artist id"",
			""duration""
		],
		where: ""duration &lt; 180"",
		limit: 100

"# New dataset released from DataverseNO

 Lewandowski, Wojciech, 2018, ""Replication data for: The Spanish completive reflexive: Idiosyncratic, motivated or both?"", [https://doi.org/10.18710/4QHOBK](https://doi.org/10.18710/4QHOBK), DataverseNO, V1, UNF:6:tokJXAhE3MEy0uanXSF5aQ== \[fileUNF\] 

&amp;#x200B;

**Description**:

Many researchers seem to think that construction grammar posits the existence of just wholly idiosyncratic constructions or form-meaning pairings. However, this idea demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of the approach, since constructions rarely emerge sui generis. Rather, construction grammar aims to balance the fact that some linguistic uses cannot be fully predicted from other well-established uses, with the fact that extensions of a construction, while not predictable, are motivated by other senses in the constructional network. This study illustrates this tenet of constructional approaches to language by providing an analysis of the Spanish completive reflexive marker se. In order to identify the different senses of the completive se-construction I used data from the Spanish corpus CREA (Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual, http://corpus.rae.es/creanet.html). Given the large size of the corpus (200 million words), the frequency search—which is merely indicative—was arbitrarily limited to constructions in which the verb appeared in 3rd person singular and was directly followed by a direct object headed by the determined articles el ‘the’ (masculine) or la ‘the’ (feminine) in singular. The data set includes all the instances of the completive reflexive found in the sample described above. (2018-10-17) ",not_spam

For this project I've been looking for data on the historic MSRP of supercars since 1966, with the introduction of the Lamborghini Miura, until present day. However, I've been facing difficulty in finding sources for this kind of data (especially in the pre-digital days). Does anyone have any suggestions on where to look? Thanks!",not_spam

**So my questions are:**

\- Where can I get data for income by postal code in European countries, if available through free sources?

\- Which are the best companies to address as an alternative to free sources? (One company for all Europe better than separate companies for each data set...)",not_spam

\- I want to save them in a json file and serve it myself from something like s3.

\- I need to find this data for specific locations (using coordinates). I use centers of first-level administrative divisions for every country and want to connect them to this weather data.

&amp;#x200B;

Options I have already tried:

\- OpenWeather - monthly average costs 470$!

\- World Bank - can only lookup by country

\- Meteostat Developers - lack of most data when using at specific location

\- World Weather Online - free trial gives only avgMinTemp, absMaxTemp and avgDailyRainfall

\- National Centers for Environmental Information - I've been tinkering there for a few hours but still can't find a way to get what i need

\- Climate Change Service - same as above and is too complicated for a person who knows nothing about climate science

\- Troposphere - seems great, but it doesn't have average temperature",not_spam

"Disclaimer: I work for bit.io, where I've hosted the analysis-ready dataset. 

I put a ton of work into cleaning up this dataset and have done several cool analyses with it. I want to share the data and I hope others will find interesting things to do with it.

Here is an analysis-ready version of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data from 2016-2020: https://l.bit.io/neiss-r

The raw data can be found here: https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/

The bit.io repository also links to the R script used for cleaning the data. The major data cleaning steps involved merging multiple years of data (originally need to download year-by-year as excel files) and translating numerical codes to more descriptive values (e.g. injury type 67 to ""Electric shock""). This involved quite a bit of careful alignment across years of data.

Some key data characteristics:
- More than 1.5M records of product-related injuries
- Five complete years of data
- Categorical columns indicating (1) which product(s) were involved in the injury; (2) which body part(s) were harmed; and (3) what the diagnosis was
- Weights to extrapolate from individual records to nationally-representative estimates
- Narrative summaries of each incident (I think there's a lot of potential for some kind of NLP project with these summaries).

Projects I've done with the data so far (more self-promotion, and hopefully some inspiration):
- [Local Outlier Factor Analysis with Scikit-Learn](https://l.bit.io/r-lof): includes a section applying outlier analysis to the NEISS data and concludes that holidays are outlier in terms of patterns of injuries (July 4 Fireworks).
- [Independence Day is the Most Dangerous Holiday](https://l.bit.io/independence-r): A holiday-themed analysis of injury data comparing holidays to determine which is the most dangerous and why (hint: fireworks).",not_spam

"I'm an undergraduate psychology student working on a research project. As part of our project, we are looking for a set of photographs. The set includes at least 1 color picture containing a person's face (preferably head shots) taken every year from age 4-18, as well as 1 in the person's 20s and 1 in their 30s (another in 40s would be great, can't be too hopeful).

&amp;#x200B;

Brief summary of the project: To assess people's ability to match voices to faces based on age across a developmental period.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this might be difficult to find, but I would greatly appreciate if one of you had a set or knows someone who does. If you can help, please message me and we can talk more about details. Also, if you know of somewhere that contains this resource or another place to search for it please let me know.

"I am currently doing a massive analysis of Reddit's entire publicly available comment dataset.  The dataset is ~1.7 billion JSON objects complete with the comment, score, author, subreddit, position in comment tree and other fields that are available through Reddit's API.  

I'm currently doing NLP analysis and also putting the entire dataset into a large searchable database using Sphinxsearch (also testing ElasticSearch).  

This dataset is over 1 terabyte uncompressed, so this would be best for larger research projects.  If you're interested in a sample month of comments, that can be arranged as well.  I am trying to find a place to host this large dataset -- I'm reaching out to Amazon since they have open data initiatives.

**EDIT:  ~~I'm putting up a Digital Ocean box with 2 TB of bandwidth and will throw an entire months worth of comments up (~ 5 gigs compressed)~~  It's now a torrent.  This will give you guys an opportunity to examine the data.  The file is structured with JSON blocks delimited by new lines (\n).**

**____________________________________________________**

One month of comments is now available here:

**UPDATE (Saturday 2015-07-03 13:26 ET)**

I'm getting a huge response from this and won't be able to immediately reply to everyone.  I am pinging some people who are helping.  There are two major issues at this point.  Getting the data from my local system to wherever and figuring out bandwidth (since this is a very large dataset).  Please keep checking for new updates.  I am working to make this data publicly available ASAP.  If you're a larger organization or university and have the ability to help seed this initially (will probably require 100 TB of bandwidth to get it rolling), please let me know.  If you can agree to do this, I'll give your organization priority over the data first.

**UPDATE 2 (15:18)**

I've purchased a seedbox.  I'll be updating the link above to the sample file.  Once I can get the full dataset to the seedbox, I'll post the torrent and magnet link to that as well.  I want to thank /u/hak8or for all his help during this process.  It's been a while since I've created torrents and he has been a huge help with explaining how it all works.  Thanks man!

**UPDATE 3 (21:09)**

I'm creating the complete torrent.  There was an issue with my seedbox not allowing public trackers for uploads, so I had to create a private tracker.  I should have a link up shortly to the massive torrent.  I would really appreciate it if people at least seed at 1:1 ratio -- and if you can do more, that's even better!  The size looks to be around ~160 GB -- a bit less than I thought.

**UPDATE 4 (00:49 July 4)**

I'm retiring for the evening.  I'm currently seeding the entire archive to two seedboxes plus two other people.  I'll post the link tomorrow evening once the seedboxes are at 100%.  This will help prevent choking the upload from my home connection if too many people jump on at once.  The seedboxes upload at around 35MB a second in the best case scenario.  We should be good tomorrow evening when I post it.  Happy July 4'th to my American friends!

**UPDATE 5 (14:44)**

Send more beer!  The seedboxes are around 75% and should be finishing up within the next 8 hours.  My next update before I retire for the night will be a magnet link to the main archive.  Thanks!

**UPDATE 6 (20:17)**

**This is the update you've been waiting for!**

The **entire** archive:  

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:7690f71ea949b868080401c749e878f98de34d3d&amp;dn=reddit%5Fdata&amp;tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.pushshift.io%3A6969%2Fannounce&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80

Please seed!

**UPDATE 7 (July 11 14:19)**

User /u/fhoffa has done a lot of great work making this data available within Google's BigQuery.   Please check out this link for more information:   /r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/

"Hi /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix and others who can answer this,

I compared the 'retrieved_on' date with the 'created_utc' date of the comments and submissions in the pushshift data in 01/2017 to 04/2017 and found that there is a huge difference between the two values. In the small random sample of comments and submissions, the difference is at least 11 days for comments and 13 days for submissions. From the dates, it seems like January comments are crawled in early Feb, Feb comments in early March, and so on. This is not what I was expecting since you said that the data is crawled in 'real-time' (with 1-2 second delays. See https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/715xp6/data_update_rate/dn9vdom/). Could you please explain what is going on? 

Below are the two values for a small random sample of comments between 01/2017 and 04/2017. Larger samples show similar things. The first value in each line is 'retrieved_on' time and second is 'created_utc' time of a comment/submission, all represented as 'number of seconds since epoch'. (You can use https://www.epochconverter.com/ to convert to human readable time)

"I'm building out a concept right now where data from disparate sources is aggregated and accessible in a unified API, or for download in standardized formats (JSON, CSV, SQL).

A few questions for the community:

1. How do you current collect data? Do you download from individual sites or mine it yourself?  Or is there a similar service available?

2. Do you think there is a need for a single API to access large amounts of data, or are data analysis needs usually so specific that people would rarely find use in having data like Education, Weather, Stocks and Sports accessible under a single API key?

3. Would you pay for a service like this for $20-30/month?

"Hi, I am currently writing my thesis in Economics on Mortality and Temperature. I handle data in R.

&amp;#x200B;

I need weekly temperature data from 2021-2000 on NUTS1 level (regional level).

&amp;#x200B;

DETAILS:

I have divided Europe in to regions (NUTS1 level) and found weekly mortality numbers for every region for every week from 2021W8 to 2020W1. That's about 1130 weeks and 100 regions. 

But, I have had trouble finding temperature data which was divided into these groups. I could boil down daily data but the only thing I have found is taken from 100.000 weather stations across Europe which is overwhelming.  


Daily data would work fine

Hello, I would like some assistance with regards to ordering data for orders. I have a screenshot of said data which I will try to upload in the comments section.

The issue is:
-orders are collected in column A using Product code numbers.
-data in Column B and C correlate. Column B are the product codes and column C product description for all the products in the store.
-evidently, not all products are ordered.
- I need to link the product codes for the products ordered to the corresponding product description in column c

Of note:
- these are not the actual products ordered. Just an example
- the data cleaning will be required for the past 5 years
- some of the product descriptions and codes have been updated and are thus missing in the columns b and c. 
- this is only an example. The actual excel files contain over 4000 rows for orders placed and 6000 for the product code and description references.
 
Is there a simple way to clean up this data rather than doing it manually? I’m quite new to this so I would be very grateful for some guidance.",not_spam

"The ICIJ has recently published a report about a number of suspicious transactions flagged by the US financial crimes enforcement agency FinCEN as Suspicious Activity Reports.

I definitely think there's some interesting analysis that can come out of analyzing these.

I'd like to see if there are any correlations with a population's obesity rates and see if and how the relationships vary with U.S. geography. 

I tried poking around the CDC website for C-section and obesity data but was not really able to make heads or tails of how to find and extract what I want. Thank you in advance for your help!",not_spam
"*Note: I'm happy to explore other possible datasets that have a similar premise of task/worker assignment as well.* 

Hi,

I'm currently working on a project that assigns the appropriate customer care worker to a customer care request/ ticket. I was wondering if there was a dataset that had the request itself (may or may not have other variables like urgency etc.,), the person who was assigned that task, and perhaps feedback on that worker's response. The closest I've found is the Apache Hadoop issues/ JIRA instance, although it doesn't have feedback, and I don't know if it only has 1000 instances because I'm only able to access it using [this](https://github.com/nkanak/advance-project-management-practice/blob/master/data/hadoop_issues.json) link. 

Thanks!",not_spam

&gt;**TL;DR:** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/measuring-belief-in-conspiracy-theories)

Hi Guys,
How are you today?

I've made made available a dataset containing answers to the The Generic Conspiracist Scale (GCBS) survey.

The Generic Conspiracist Scale (GCBS) was created for measuring belief in conspiracy theories.
When trying to measure belief in conspiracy theories, researchers had typically asked questions about specific conspiracy theories.
The GCBS attempts to correct this with the approach of asking broad questions about underlying assumption that are presumed to underlie such beliefs.
The GCBS measures an overall score and five facet scores.
This is a dataset of 2K Answers to the 15 scale rated questions along with 30+ other variables including demographics and technical information.

Credit for the original research paper: The scale was developed by Robert Brotherton, Christopher C. French and Alan D. Pickering of Goldsmiths University of London in 2013.

You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/measuring-belief-in-conspiracy-theories).

I did look up ""new car prices [year] UK"" or ""new car specs [year] UK"", ""list price cars [year] UK"" on Google but couldn't find them at all, or indeed any results that were relevant.

I was trying to categorise prices by reg-plate/year, e.g. 1979 V (January), 1979 V (February) etc., 1980 V (January), 1980 V (February) etc., 1980 W (January), 1980 W (February) etc. as specifications and prices do change per month and per year. This also applies to commercial vehicles too [Ford Transit, Volkswagen Transporter etc.].

The only reason I need this data is twofold - as a primary/secondary source, and additional data for with the car pages to use.

This is an example of how the data would look in excel [hypothetical data here for example purposes]:

Make | Model | Engine | Fuel | Price | Introduced
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
**AUDI**|_|_|_|||
**A4 Saloon**|_|_|_|||
A4 1.8T 20V Sport | 4 Door Saloon | 4/1788 | Petrol | £18,950 | March-1995

Only problem with that link is it's limited to businesses from Seattle. There's a similar set I found for the city of Tacoma, but it doesn't provide contact information. There are sites like the Washington state Corporations and Charities Filing System that work great, but the information isn't as digestible.

"Hi,

Question: What software/web browser/web page do you use to get macroeconomic data? How would you search for more complicated data? I am mainly focused on US data but there are some things that I could not find on [https://www.fedsearch.org](https://www.fedsearch.org/) and [https://search.bea.gov/](https://search.bea.gov/) usually they direct you to articles instead of charts.

I don't usually write on Reddit, but I think, after wasting so much time trying to get the information on my own and not getting anywhere I think it's time to ask for help. I'm working on a final project for my University Degree and  I would like to check, what I am reading actually is true looking at the charts. Sometimes the writers don't specify whether they are talking about nominal or real values and things like that. Even though I can get some of that information if I look extensively, I will spend most of my time checking facts rather than reading about them. And some charts I couldn't even get, for example, the purchase of US bonds of the Japanese Government throughout history. I have a friend that has access to the Bloomberg Terminal but I don't want to bother him every day.",not_spam

"# **EDIT** to clarify some excellent questions in the comments:
- I am using Ubuntu 16.04
- I don't need to annotate the sentences/text in each row, just need to check (one at a time) that the assigned label is correct. Evaluation of the correctness of the label is done manually, not by any programmatic process.
- `sed` and `awk` would be fine if I knew beforehand which lines need to be changed (which I don't), which is why I need a more iterative interactive approach.
- Given the large number of rows (~4 million) in the CSV, a spreadsheet approach would probably require me to break the single CSV into multiple files. I could be completely wrong about this as I don't do a whole lot of data preprocessing in spreadsheets.

--------
I have a set of CSVs with text and a classification in them. Some of these are incorrectly classified in the raw data and I would like to fix the labels by hand.

I found http://sloth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ which is used for fixing/creating image labels by hand but haven't yet found something for text datasets.

I could, of course, load the CSVs up in a spreadsheet but I have close to 4 million sentences and I would only like to go down the spreadsheet route if there is nothing else available.

**Sample Data**

\# | Class | Text
---|--------|---------
1 | 1 | This is some text
2 | 1 | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
3 | 0 | Sed vestibulum tempor enim vel porta
4 | 0 | sed laoreet nisi accumsan non. Integer et sollicitudin velit.
5 | 0 | Duis mollis ante odio, at lacinia arcu ullamcorper sit amet.
... and so on. Let's say I would like to change the class of rows 2 and 4.
I've identified these by some manual process but I'm hoping the tool can show me the rows one by one.

Worst case, I'll write something myself to do it but want to be sure there isn't something out there already.

"   Tossing this out there for anyone who might be interested in exploring cutting edge AI unsupervised machine learning tech. Having just discovered this community and being a longtime Reddit user myself I felt some urge to get an idea from professional data scientists about their thoughts with regards to your thoughts on potential application and comparison to other tools.  Currently we are a primarily eDiscovery platform that is also utilized by law enforcement and other organizations with large data sets.  We have the following data sets available to review as a demonstration:

[https://demo.agnesintel.com/](https://demo.agnesintel.com/)

* **Text Documents:** 

AGNES has provided the Enron email corpus for review in this demo. This silo provides an example of a standard email corpus. You can create research and review projects, search through the emails using pertinent names and terms, and toggle back and forth between the emails and their attachments. Watch how quickly the important documents become readily available.

* **Audio:**

AGNES shows approximately a thousand hours of the Joe Rogan podcast. AGNES platform transcribes, indexes, binds, and applies AI-powered search to audio files. Our technology shows you the entire contents of the data-set at a glance, uncovers patterns, codes and slang, and helps you find what you’re looking for faster than you thought possible.

* **Audio-Based Video:**

AGNES has provided 70 years of State of the Union Addresses to demonstrate our video capabilities. When you find a topic of interest, you will be brought right to the section of the video you’re interested in. You can explore how issues were discussed differently over time, find common threads, and use context-driven search to show you the complete picture on any issue.

We also welcome any requests with pro-bono/non-profit data sets for review, or other reasonable requests to submit your data to explore further.

Any and all feedback is appreciated and I'm sure that I, as well some other co-workers more experienced in the field, can contribute to your inquiries as well. To give a quick summary: we are an AI based platform that is an **unsupervised** technology without any need for TAR, but also has the capability to fully transcribe, index and create an organic table of contents for audio and video data, within the context of the information itself, which is what makes our tech stand out from the rest.

[https://demo.agnesintel.com/](https://demo.agnesintel.com/)

There's absolutely no commitment, hidden gimmicks, soft paywall or personal/payment info needed - but we would love to get some constructive feedback about what we want to be the most advanced AI-based data forensic tool out there.

Key attributes of our platform:

* **AI based** intuition and user input learning – more advanced and replacing TAR, training sets and “predictive coding” - Unsupervised AI machine learning
* Context based results to maximize relevancy - data is sorted into an organic table of contents, allowing user to identify issues/concepts to find that ""unknown, unknown"" information they may not even be aware of
* **Audio/Video review** – drastically reduce man-hours to review such data",not_spam

Hi /r/datasets!

I'm a computer science student currently researching humour theory and how to generate humor with computers.
For this, I'm creating a dataset with human rated ""I like my X like I like my Y, Z"" jokes.
I intend to release this anonymised dataset after I finish my thesis on it next month such that other researchers can also benefit from this dataset!

In order to gather this training data, I created a website called [JokeJudger.com](http://jokejudger.com) where you can **rate and create jokes**. It also aims to help the joke creators by giving them anonymous feedback from other users as a reward. There are also mechanisms in place to [generate challenges](http://www.jokejudger.com/#/create), and even a suggestion system to help with associations.

I'm currently looking for more people to help me out with this. If you'd like to help and [create](http://www.jokejudger.com/#/create)/[judge](http://www.jokejudger.com/#/rate) some jokes on the [site](http://jokejudger.com) and thus improve the quality of this future dataset, that'd be greatly appreciated!

The json files contain the genre preferences of users - each key is a  user id, the genres loved are given as lists. Genre notations are  consistent across users.

" 

Health records are seeing a resurgence of interest as companies roll out creative new ways to let people interact with their health information.

Lets take a deep dive

**1) Change is a foot**

Companies are making it possible for users to access all of their medical encounters, no matter how unwieldy the format.

**2) How?**

PicnicHealth for example as built a system to field everything from PDFs to unstructured doctor's notes to let its users focus on self-care rather than data management.

**3) Why?**

Turning unstructured data into structured data is really meaningful. Giving patients practical, tangible control over their data = better health. Patients with a chronic or serious illness often see multiple providers.

**4) Why do we need this?**

The answer is two fold -

People talk about the work of being a patient, and how it’s essentially a project manager job. Being forced to see a provider ontop of being sick and worrying if all the necessary data is in order is a pain point.

**5) Part two**

Insurer or the research organization running a study are willing to sponsor accounts for patients and pay the subscription. Putting all this information in one place would be a major value-add for both the patient &amp; the insurer/researcher.

**6) How is this better?**

The secret sauce is being able to do all that grunt work of getting data that’s not available through APIs. Those only give you 10 to 20% of the data. Every doctor’s office has a way to get patient records, and this is a way to make that easier

**7) Upside for the Patient?**

It helps answer questions like

"I've got Northern Ireland's 2011 census data. There are 45 CSVs containing data for roughly 4500 small areas that cover the region. The data is what I would consider crosstab format. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/dIop4) are two examples of how of the CSVs are formatted. Also note that in addition to the raw count column there is also a percent column for each variable.

I'm interested in mapping this data, particularly to see relationships between religious identification and other demographic characteristics. I have a shapefile and have been able to load some of this into Tableau successfully but I'm really not sure how to proceed. I feel like the most obvious, simplest solution would just be to join all of this together by area ID but I don't know if that's appropriate.

"Hi all,

I am looking for data corresponding to UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically [SDG11](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11) concerning sustainable cities. Each goal has several targets and indicators that help in measuring the progress (in this case, making the cities sustainable), ~~for ex -~~

1. ~~percentage of population in slums.~~
2. ~~proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport~~
3. ~~Deaths and injuries from natural disasters~~

# These are the indicators for SDG11 / the data I am looking for city-wise

1. Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing
2. Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
3. Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate
4. Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically
5. Total expenditure (public and private) per capita spent on the preservation, protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritage, by type of heritage (cultural, natural, mixed and World Heritage Centre designation), level of government (national, regional and local/municipal), type of expenditure (operating expenditure/investment) and type of private funding (donations in kind, private non-profit sector and sponsorship)
6. Number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people
7. Direct disaster economic loss in relation to global GDP, including disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services
8. Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities
9. Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)
10. Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
11. Proportion of persons victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age, disability status and place of occurrence, in the previous 12 months
12. Proportion of population living in cities that implement urban and regional development plans integrating population projections and resource needs, by size of city
13. Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030a
14. Number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies
15. Proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials

I found several datasets on country level for example on the [SDG Tracker](https://sdg-tracker.org/) by [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/) and [Eurostat (EU database)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) but none of them contain at the city level.

There are famous and totally unknown artists in there. I wish to filter the famous from the unknown. I thought of a way by doing this: each artist page has a number of fans. My goal is to create an Microsoft Excel sheet with all the artists from this list, combined with their fan-count. Does anyone know a tool for me in order to do this?

"From the [FAQ](http://openflights.org/faq): 

**What is OpenFlights?**

In a nutshell, it's a tool that lets you map your flights around the world, search and filter them in all sorts of interesting ways, calculate statistics automatically, and share the resulting maps with friends and the world. You can also check airport route maps for nearly every airport in the world and find out what airlines fly where.

**What can I do with OpenFlights?**

Quite a few things:

* Track exactly how far you've flown and how much time you've spent sitting on a plane. (Quite a few of our members have been to the Moon and back, but nobody has yet reached Mars.)
* See at a glance where you've been and where you're going.
Rapidly search your flight history: now when did I go to the Bahamas, and on what airline?
* Share your flights and trips with friends.
* Check where you can fly to from any airport, or any pair of airports. 
* Check where you can fly to with any airline. 
* Coordinate flights for conferences and other events.
* View your flights in gorgeous 3D with Google Earth and other visualization apps. (Learn more)

**Why is OpenFlights better than other similar services?**

Well, as far as we know there actually isn't anything quite like OpenFlights out there, but here are some things that separate us from the putative competition:

* OpenFlights has a dynamic map. You can pan, zoom, select, scroll and explore all you like!
* OpenFlights is user-friendly and efficient. Everything's on the same page!
* OpenFlights makes searching really easy. Point and click!
* OpenFlights has a powerful filter. Three clicks, and your map will show only Singapore Airlines flights in business class in 2007.
* OpenFlights works in realtime. Make any change, and you'll see it right then and there.
* OpenFlights supports ""trips"" You can join up any flights together into a trip, which you can then display on its own page and even share with friends.
* OpenFlights is free in spirit. We don't try to lock you in: it's easy to import your data and export copies for safekeeping.
* OpenFlights is free software. All our source code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License and can be downloaded from GitHub, so you can set up your own copy or just use the bits you like. Airport, airline and route data is freely available as well.
* OpenFlights can be used anywhere. No need to install any programs, synchronize data or take care of backups, just point your browser to the site.

I haven’t frequented this subreddit much, and I didn’t see anything in the rules against this kind of post, but if there is a better subreddit to ask or if this isn’t appropriate just let me know.

I have a data analysis assignment for school, and I wanted to use data from a specific website(I’ll keep everything generic/anonymous). The ToS claims copyright on the data, and prohibits web scraping, but the data is entirely accessible by the public. A brief review of some legal resources seems to indicate that this is *okay*, but I really don’t want to take any chances. I have already incurred a nice little 429 warning as well.

"While looking for information on a company registered in Illinois, USA* I found it was quite difficult to look for such info. Illinois does not allow company data to be republished in any form from the *Secretary of State* and even has laws (possibly the only US state) to prosecute anyone who does. The SOS's website also isn't accessible outside the United States.

This makes it harder to track companies and hold them accountable. Even Delaware (infamous for its corporate favorable laws) freely publishes and makes accessible basic company data to everyone. Illinois is the only US state that is not in the OpenCorporates database, a website which collates information from various company registers around the world.

Though its great that the data is there on the SOS's website such basic corporate data should be openly accessible.

"Hi, was wondering if anyone had experience or advice for someone looking to sell data generated by users on a connected TV app. (I think this post belongs here, but let me know if there's someone else that would be more appropriate)

A few years ago for a course I was taking I programmed an app for connected tv devices (think Amazon Fire, Roku or Apple TV). At the time it didn't get much traction, but over the past few months though it has skyrocketed to 30k DAU and 100k MAU. 

Without mentioning what the app is, I think there is some pretty unique characteristics about the usage dataset generated that could be valuable to others, however I have no clue where to even start looking for buyers. I know in the mobile world it's as easy as putting a data broker's sdk into your app and then they pay you, but after some pretty extensive googling I can't find anything similar for connected tv.

Would love to hear if anyone has thoughts or ideas on who I can sell to and has to begin pricing/knowing the value of my data as usage continues to increase.",not_spam

I need to create a dataset for their preferences so that if on a given night I say I’d like to go get Italian and pay $30 I would be able to pivot the data and see whose budget I’m within and who likes Italian food and who dislikes Italians food.

The problem is I can’t figure out how to organize the preference section of the data set. While min and max price are easily added as a single cell in a spread sheet for each person. Some of the individuals like 12 foods and dislike 5. What is the best way to organize the data so I can easily analyze the data set to figure out which individuals I would and would not like to ask to go to dinner with.

"448 million search terms along with the last 24 month's worth of per-month search frequencies. Given the market share of the search engine from which this data came, multiplying these monthly counts by about 15 should yield the total search volume across all search engines.

Uncompressed, the file is about 53GB. Compressed it's about 5GB.

Each line of the file is a JSON object that looks like this:

You can ignore the \_id property (I'd ideally have removed that property when I exported the data). The two relevant properties are ""keyphrase"" and ""trend"". The numbers at the end of the ""trend"" array are the most recent frequencies. Each item in the ""trend"" array is the number of searches that month, globally. The data was collected a few months before the end of 2019.

Note that some of the keyphrases have 4 dollar-signs in them like this:

    ""keyphrase"":""hackathon$$$$hackathon""

I'm not sure what this means (it's just what the API returned), so I just ignored these in my analyses. It may have something to do with new advanced search engine features like knowledge graphs, but I don't know.

"I'm releasing [239,621 Hackernews datasets](https://github.com/massanishi/hackernews-post-datasets) from the past 5 years. Based on the official item API, this focuses only on the main posts with at least 2 engagements.

Motivation:

Hackernews offers an excellent [API via Firebase](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). Unfortunately, their fetch method doesn't offer any way to filter by item types. So collecting all posts take excessively long thanks to all the comments (the posts in datasets are about 1.5% of the items returned).

With posts as a starting point, you can easily trace the hierarchy from ""kids"" fields.

Potential Usage:

- Generate popular titles.
- Collect comments in a hierarchical order for further training.
- Analyze popular topics in the engineering community.
- Identify the best time to post for maximum engagement.",not_spam

I'm an undergrad student and I'm about to write my thesis, but I need help finding data that fits. The idea is to observe the evolution of communities in Affiliation Networks. To observe the evolution I need a network with timestamps on the edges. I googled a lot and couldn't really find an affiliation network with timestamps such as here: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/ or http://www.barabasilab.com/rs-netdb.php. Does anybody here know other sources that might be worth looking at? I found several bipartite graphs with timestamps, such as for when a user listens to a song from a musician. My idea was, if can't find anything, to create out of this data an affiliation network of a user that likes at time t=0 the band XY and observe how/if this changes until t=1. The assumption is basically that a user isn't into a band anymore if they didn't listen to it in the next interval. In general this model is far from reality I guess, but it's a start. I could group the data in the musician model by genre and investigate whether there is a pattern to if/how the users change there music preferences. Such that: If a new musician/band appears, does the user still listen to songs they were before, to the exclusion of the new music, or do they keep track with what is popular/new at the moment?

"Hi guys,

I was looking for some website that shared good statistical data, like sales numbers of phones (by brand/model), revenue of different businesses, funding sources of political parties etc. I noticed that while lots of data globally, there isn't a good one stop website for Indian data. All I get on googling is news figures on newspapers with often very poorly presented data (wall of paragraphs where a graphic would have been so much better), and only data limited to a particular event, not organized searchable stuff.

I saw this awesome site called Statista, but it's behind a huge paywall.

I have some examples that I found good below:

1. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269487/top-5-india-smartphone-vendors/

2. http://gs.statcounter.com/

3. http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor

Would you be kind enough to suggest a few? Generic stat sites would be good, otherwise if you have any favorite ones for tech items, finances, etc... those would also add value.

Thanks in advance.

"I am currently a undergraduate sophomore at my college and I am soon going to declare my major. I want to make sure that I am picking the right degree/major/minor for becoming a business intelligence analyst/specialist and a data analyst. .The degree is called MIS (management information systems). The degree is a mixture between business and information technology. All the business classes I already finished like marketing, accounting, finance, management, etc. 

1. The soon to be technical classes I will take are python, database management systems, SQL, system analysis, data warehousing, ETL, data analytics, business intelligence, project management, and an internship.  Are those classes worth taking for the data field? I already now those are classes that are good in the data field but I just want to make sure.

2. Are any of those particular subjects difficult to learn as in are the concepts hard to understand? If you need a comparsion for something I find difficult it's something that requires tremendous hours of studying to fully understand the concept of what is being taught in class like computer engineering majors. How would you rank them from being the most difficult to being the easiest?

3.If it turns out that I don't like data analytics once I graduate, what other carrer fields can I go into that aren't a business intelligence specialist or a data analyst? 

4 .As for the minor, my college recommends I minor in marketing, applied economics, supply chain or finance. Out of those 4 options which one will be the best and most broad in the data analyst field?

My friends and I built [databar.ai](https://www.databar.ai), a free no-code API tool that lets you get datasets from all over the web without code (works for \~100 APIs right now). We started it out as a side-project/internal tool and thought that others might find it useful too.

Basically all you do is pick an API you want to use (for example Coin Gecko or [Data.gov](https://Data.gov)), customize your request with parameters, and get a clean, structured csv/xslx file in return.

Right now you can get datasets on:

\- Anything relating to crypto (social media stats, market caps, volumes, ROIs, etc.)

\- Finance (public financials, IPO data, transcripts, technicals, DCFs)

\- Scraped data (news articles/blogs, App store reviews)

\- Public data (crime, education, environment, etc.)

\- Anything to do with COVID

Hi everyone!

As many of you might know, Kaggle datasets vary in terms of licensing: some are open, some are good for academic use, and some you have to ask the distributor for permission to use for other projects.

This got me thinking: let's pretend that there's a website with a lot of copyrighted images, free to download. Do any of these actions have licensing issues, assuming I'm not able to get in touch with the copyright holder in advance?

1. Using the images to create models, then crediting the website with the dataset used to create them in a journal article

2. Same as 1), but also publishing the processed dataset with features used (not enough information to recreate any images in the dataset)

3. Same as 2), but also publishing image variants generated by a model

4. Using the images to create a model which may be sold as a corporate product

I feel like 1 and 2 are probably okay, while 3 and 4 may not be. However, I have absolutely no basis for this claim, legally or otherwise.

My research focuses on external validity, so in my previous analyses, I have been focusing on the effect modification associated with independent variables. As an example, I have explored the differences in outcomes for patients suffering from COPD between three periods of time with diverging criteria for provision of a telemedicine service.

In exchange for letting me analyse your data, which I will, of course, use only for the explained purposes, I can offer you co-authorship (according to the Vancouver protocol, http://www.research.mq.edu.au/documents/policies/Vancouver.pdf) of an article along with the chance of having your research project assessed for external validity.

I am not sure if this is the appropriate sub to post this. Please let me know the correct sub to post this question to. Anyway, back to my question.

I am assuming that many of you are familiar with the [HUBZone](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/hubzone-program). There are designated areas in the US which are called HUB Zones. Small businesses located in these areas who are certified as a HUB Zone business get preference when Federal contracts are awarded. Now, the areas defined are in terms of census tracts, counties and Indian reservation lands. My goal is to see if socio-economic standards have improved over the past couple of years in those areas.

Now, the counties, census tracts and Indian lands overlap in many locations. If I can get the census tracts that comprise of all these regions, I can cover all the regions.

Now, coming to my problem. I can only get information of various indicators like GDP, income, etc at the county level. How can I get this at the census tract level? I am looking exclusively for census tract information as it is the smallest level of granularity and can effectively cover all the regions in the HUBZone (counties and Indian lands).

"Hi, I'm really interested in the economic impacts that the legalization of marijuana could have on US states that have yet to fully legalize. I think I'm going to need a few different datasets to fully research this topic. I'm interested in anything from arrests (misdemeanors or felonies) related to marijuana to the number of estimated users per state/country wide, I understand this data might be hard to come by as most of this will be self-reported. 

I'm also interested in attempting to project tax-revenue that could be generated as well as what industries would hurt/benefit from legalization; I'm assuming most of this data might come from Colorado if it is reported at all. Datasets on alcohol/tobacco tax could help as well. 

Really any kind of datasets you guys could throw my way would help as the datasets I have currently aren't very detailed. Any information or datasets on CBD and CBD clinical trials would also help. Thanks to anybody who hits me with a link, I know I'm asking for a lot.",not_spam

6. Some of the data is spread across 2 or more files and needs to be denormalised
7. There are misspellings in the data due to human errors

"Hey all, we just released the dataset we collected at TechCrunch Disrupt to build [a computer vision powered chess board analyzer](https://devpost.com/software/chess-boss).

The dataset is available for download here: [https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full)

We also published a tutorial showing how to use it to [train a YOLO v3 object detection model](https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-a-yolov3-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/) like the one we used in our hackathon project.

PS - this is our first trial run of releasing a public dataset through [Roboflow](https://roboflow.ai), a tool we're working on to improve the computer vision workflow. We'd love to have you try it out and get your feedback.

" This dataset includes Direct Borohydride Fuel Cell (DBFC) impedance and polarization test in anode with Pd/C, Pt/C and Pd decorated Ni–Co/rGO catalysts. In fact, different concentration of Sodium Borohydride (SBH), applied voltages and various anode catalysts loading with explanation of experimental details of electrochemical analysis are considered in data. Voltage, power density and resistance of DBFC change as a function of weight percent of SBH (%), applied voltage and amount of anode catalyst loading that are evaluated by polarization and impedance curves with using appropriate equivalent circuit of fuel cell. Can be stated that interpretation of electrochemical behavior changes by the data of related cell is inevitable, which can be useful in simulation, power source investigation and depth analysis in DB fuel cell researches.

"Statistics such as PPG, RPG, TS%, etc in college as well as general stats like age, height, and wingspan are often used to predict future NBA success and I have an idea for a model that incorporates a few more variables into the mix for potentially better accuracy. Gathering these college statistics is very difficult due to the sheer number of college basketball players relevant to the how many of these players are drafted.

"# New dataset released from DataverseNO

 Lewandowski, Wojciech, 2018, ""Replication data for: The Spanish completive reflexive: Idiosyncratic, motivated or both?"", [https://doi.org/10.18710/4QHOBK](https://doi.org/10.18710/4QHOBK), DataverseNO, V1, UNF:6:tokJXAhE3MEy0uanXSF5aQ== \[fileUNF\] 

&amp;#x200B;

**Description**:

Many researchers seem to think that construction grammar posits the existence of just wholly idiosyncratic constructions or form-meaning pairings. However, this idea demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of the approach, since constructions rarely emerge sui generis. Rather, construction grammar aims to balance the fact that some linguistic uses cannot be fully predicted from other well-established uses, with the fact that extensions of a construction, while not predictable, are motivated by other senses in the constructional network. This study illustrates this tenet of constructional approaches to language by providing an analysis of the Spanish completive reflexive marker se. In order to identify the different senses of the completive se-construction I used data from the Spanish corpus CREA (Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual, http://corpus.rae.es/creanet.html). Given the large size of the corpus (200 million words), the frequency search—which is merely indicative—was arbitrarily limited to constructions in which the verb appeared in 3rd person singular and was directly followed by a direct object headed by the determined articles el ‘the’ (masculine) or la ‘the’ (feminine) in singular. The data set includes all the instances of the completive reflexive found in the sample described above. (2018-10-17) ",not_spam

"Hi everyone!

My name's Christian, and I'd like to share what we've been building at [OrgStack](https://orgstack.io/).  I'm posting this here as a ""request for feedback"" from the community that we serve.

Poor data quality is a costly problem for many organizations.  Invalid data is responsible for major product/service outages, and it can be very  difficult to pinpoint the root cause of data-related incidents.  This requires a large investment of engineering resources.

OrgStack aims to streamline the process of managing data sources, receiving critical alerts, and tracing incidents to their source.  While building a solution to this problem, we drew inspiration from some of our favorite tools, including NPM, Loggly, and Jenkins.

A few baseline questions:

* Is data validation / data quality currently a problem for you?
* How do you solve it now?
* Which differentiating features would get you to switch?
* What would your ideal solution look like?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.  We really appreciate it!

"Hello, I am currently working on a final year project. I have decided that I want to work with summarising textbooks using seq2seq.

I have found some implementations of seq2seq text summarization using TensorFlow on GitHub, so I have examples of working solutions I can learn from.

I have run into the problem of not being able to find any datasets specifically where textbooks are given with summaries. 

However, I have managed to find datasets for other types of texts; [TensorFlow's Scientific papers dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/scientific_papers). Where papers are given with abstracts (which can be treated as a summary).

I am not an expert in ML, but I am considering using these datasets and then fine-tuning the model using a small dataset I will manually create with Textbooks and summaries. 

There are some similar characteristics between the data, so I would assume that the model would be able to transfer some things it learns from the scientific papers to the textbooks.

I do not have the slightest clue about how reasonable or successful this might turn out. I am looking any advice, resources or alternatives to what I have mentioned above.

" I observe a strange problem when working with the Fama-French datsets published on Kenneth French [website](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).

The Datasets compute different portfolios using price data at the beginning of t (Opening price). One of them is the excess return on the market, value-weight return of all CRSP firms incorporated in the US and listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ. For the risk-free rate, the one-month Treasury bill rate is used. 

Firstly, I  use the ""Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3) \[Daily\] dataset"". I merge it with a dataset composed of  the opening stock prices of different companies obtained from Refinitiv Eikon Datastream (RED). I compute the monthly excess return (ER) of each stock. Furthermore, I use the one-month Treasury bill rate to compute the excess returns, provided by the Fama-French dataset.  Then regress each company's time series of excess return on the Fama-French factors. Mainly for now, I want to focus on the CAPM, thus on the market excess return (mktrf).

Hence, regress: ER on mktrf. 

For this regression, I obtain significant results for the market excess return on the 1% level. I can mostly reject the existence of a constant. That aligns very well with the CAPM theorie. Moreover, plotting the ER and the mktrf I can see the positive correlation. Plotting companies ER and ß with a linear fit, I can observe the Security Market Line (SML) too. 

The problem:  Secondly, I  use the ""Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3) dataset"". This contains monthly and yearly factors. I clear the dataset for monthly data only. Then, I merge it again with opening stock prices of different companies from RED. Similarily, I compute the ER.  Again, I regress each company's time series of excess return on the Fama-French factors. Focusing on the CAPM I run the regression:  

Regress: ER on mktrf. 

For this regression, I obtain no significant results for the market excess return. However, I cannot reject the existence of a constant, it rather is signifiacnt and takes a value close to 1.  That aligns not at all with the CAPM theorie and honestly leaves me clueless.  Plotting the ER and the mktrf I can see no correlation at all, aswell as no SML when including a linear fit in the ER and ß plot. 

I checked the company's prices. They are correct. I controlled how I computed the returns. They are correct, too.  I downloaded the Fama-French factors multiple times, and they do not change. 

Can someone explain this to me? 

Thank you for reading!

Have a great day. Best for you,

"Hey everyone,

I was trying to figure out whether there was an easily accessible version of the UC school salary data available somewhere (i.e. something in csv-type format or similar). I know that you can search the database online at  [Compensation at the University of California: Annual Wage (ucop.edu)](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/), but they don't allow for easy bulk downloads. I found two other sources that are missing either the name of the employee or the location. Does anybody know if someone has perhaps scraped the site above already or if it's available somewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT -- I had looked into  [2019 salaries for University of California | Transparent California](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2019/university-of-california/) (but they are missing info on the campus/location) and also into  [GCC : University of California, Los Angeles (2019) &lt;&lt; University of California](https://publicpay.ca.gov/Reports/HigherEducations/UCEntity.aspx?entityid=8241&amp;year=2019) (which has information on the location but is omitting the employee's names) already.

"Moving forward, I'm going to be creating .xz compressed files for all monthly dumps along with yearly roll-ups for anything big data related.  

You will notice that there are xz folders under the Reddit comment and submission folders:

http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/xz/

These files will be complete year roll-ups for comments and submissions.  I am also including PAR2 parity files (10% redundancy) along with the .xz files.  You only need to download the .xz file and the .PAR2 file to verify the parity.  

If for whatever reason there is a problem with the parity check, you can rebuild the data from the additional parity files.  If you want to archive this data yourself, I would recommend downloading all the parity files as well.  The xz compression is so efficient, that even with the 10% parity files, the total file size is still smaller than the bz2 compression format.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.  Much love and appreciation to /u/bwbaugh and /u/skeeto for their assistance and suggestions.  This makes the most sense in the long-run -- the xz compression format is superior and together with the parity files, it makes a great long-term solution for data archival.  If you want to verify the file, you can do so by using either of these commands (linux):

    par2verify RS_2017-06
    par2 verify RS_2017-06

**Example Output:**

    Verifying source files:

    Target: ""RS_2017-06.xz"" - found.

    All files are correct, repair is not required.

Windows probably has a tool for PAR2 file management but I'm not familiar with it.  Maybe someone can recommend a good tool for Windows?  This program looks legitimate:  http://www.quickpar.org.uk/

Anyway, I'm trying to conduct some economic analysis for a region of \~10 counties and am trying to use Bureau of Labor Statistics data, specifically the [Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages](https://data.bls.gov/cew/apps/data_views/data_views.htm) to do it. Theoretically I could pull the data for each county separately and then add it together, but I don't want to have to do that.

So, for one, I can't seem to find their raw data. The [""About"" tab](https://data.bls.gov/cew/apps/data_views/data_views.htm#tab=About) from that page links [here](https://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm) for the Data Files, and that has an error page. So, if anyone knows where I can actually access that raw data, let me know!

Second, I am definitely new to much of this, and while I believe I could piece it together on my own, I welcome any guidance you want to throw my way as I start to dig into this stuff.

Citation graphs are a way to see how cases are connected and answer questions about the law, like ""What's the most influential case"" or ""What's the most cited jurisdiction?"". Here's our first visualization of the dataset that shows how states and jurisdictions cite each other: [case.law/exhibits/cite-grid](https://case.law/exhibits/cite-grid)

"So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler (and prettier) to actually enter the data. Are there any easy (no complex coding skills required) solutions for this? 

In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match (the same three players). The data gathered is (for each player)- 

 \- Character selected

 \- Rank

 \- Kills (including WHO they killed)

 \- Damage Given

 \- and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K/D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the 'kills' are shown as something like ""J2D1"" if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the 'enter kills' screen to automatically show two icons (J and D for N, N and J for D, etc) that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. 

So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It's totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it'd make a cool design project for my design portfolio. My programming skills are rudimentary though, so I'd rather use something that doesn't require too much advanced programming skills...

Looking around, and while much of the scientific data sets are definitely interesting enough to play with, I haven't found anything less than a Gig.

Suggestions? My requirements:

* 2 - 5 tables with foreign key (gotta use join, right)
* 10 to 50 Megs (roughly)

"Hi,
I have updated the torrent for the Reddit comment data set.

There are two torrents:
[The first torrent](http://code.dewarim.com/reddit-2016-08.torrent) is simply a collection of all comments as collected by pushshift.io (files available individually). Format is JSON, compressed by bz2 per month. Download size: 236 GByte

[The second torrent](http://code.dewarim.com/reddit-parquet-sentiment-2016-08.torrent) contains the same data plus the sentiment score for each comment (score, max_positive, max_negative). The format is Apache Parquet, which makes this better suited for Spark/Hadoop queries. Download size: 419 GByte

With sentiment data, you can compute who is the most positive commentor of reddit (Spoiler: bots and people who compliment the ladies on /gonewild) or which [car brands](http://code.dewarim.com/index.html) are popular on reddit).  

I have written some simple code for working with both formats which can be found on [Github:reddit-data-tools](https://github.com/dewarim/reddit-data-tools)",not_spam

This is my first post to r/datasets so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong. I've looked for a good dataset on job search and historical hiring with dimensions on position title, position required attributes, applicant resume skills posted vs hired etc.. with all identifying information scrubbed. I'm thinking the dataset I'm looking for doesn't exist so I will probably need to create it. I think there are government labor statistics for positions by industry, but Indeed / Monster etc.. don't have any detailed public datasets. Can you point me to any public datasets that have related information and as for scraping info from Indeed or other hiring sites. Would I need an api key or do you think the company would allow web crawling / scraping without blocking my IP? Another source might be job posting on craigslist.

Could  I just replace all  the answers with numerical values? In the image I  added I tried to  show what my questions are like. Can I just replace 0 -  1 times/hours  with 1, then 2 -3 times/hours with 2 and so on? If I do  this for each  question and have values ranging from 1 - 4 on each  question, will the  software be able to do correlations/statistical tests  between them?

"Introduction

Probably  every data scientist  has come across a situation where you have  created many different  models, with different parameters or the entire  architecture, and  started experimenting.

Aside  from the model architecture, you  wanted to experiment with the choice  of optimizer, learning rate, number  of epochs, and so on. Thus, in  fact, you will have many different  experiments and it will become more  and more difficult to structure the  results obtained. In this article,  we'll show you how to properly and  conveniently manage and log your  machine and deep learning experiments.

Today   there are many utilities that allow you to conveniently manage your   experiments, such as: Weights &amp; Biases, MlFlow, Neptune, Comet.ml   and others.

[MlFlow](https://mlflow.org/)  is an open  source platform for managing the machine learning  lifecycle. This  platform is great for single use, but not very suitable  for use in large  teams, or if you have a large number of experiments.

[Neptune](https://neptune.ai/)   is a lightweight run management tool that helps you keep track of your   machine learning runs. It offers 3 types of subscriptions, 2 of which   are paid. If you are going to use this service individually, then you   will get free access.

[Comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/)   is a machine learning platform for tracking, comparing, explaining and   optimizing experiments and models. It also provides different   subscriptions, but there is a limit on the maximum number of team   members equal to 5.

We will show you how to effectively log experiments using one of these platforms, namely [***Weights &amp; Biases***](https://wandb.ai/site).

Weights &amp; Biases overview

W&amp;B   is a platform that helps data scientists to track their models,   datasets, system information and many other features. With a few lines   of code you can start tracking everything of these features. It is a   paid utility for team use, but provides free access for personal and   academic purposes.

You can use  W&amp;B with your favourite  framework, this platform supports many  machine learning and deep  learning frameworks, like tensorflow, keras,  pytorch, sklearn, fastai  and many others. All tracking information will  be sent to the dedicated  project page on the W&amp;B website, from  which you can open high  quality visualizations, aggregate information  and compare models or  parameters.

One  of the advantages of remotely storing the  experiment’s information is  that it is easy to collaborate on the same  project and share the  results with your teammates. W&amp;B provides 4  useful tools:

1. **Dashboard:** Experiment tracking
2. **Artifacts:** Dataset versioning, model versioning
3. **Sweeps:** Hyperparameter optimization
4. **Reports:** Save and share reproducible findings

In our tutorial we will consider every one of these tools.

"I'm looking to buy a car, possibly used, and one of the major factors in my decision on which one to get is going to be the total cost of ownership over the time period I plan to own the car.

There are plenty of websites out there that let you calculate the total cost of ownership of any particular model of vehicle, but all the ones I could find were heavily focused on new vehicles. (E.g. How much will it cost you to buy this vehicle new and own it for 5 years?) This doesn't help me, as I also want to consider the possibility of buying used in order to minimize the higher depreciation costs of the first several years of ownership.

Ideally what I want to do is plot the historical average total cost of ownership of various car models over the lifetime of those vehicles, in order to find the time period where that cost is minimized. For example, suppose one model of car has a high cost of ownership during its first two years due to depreciation, then that cost levels off for years 3-5 before it starts ramping up again due to higher repair and maintenance costs. In such a case I would conclude that it's most cost efficient to buy that particular model of car used when it's 2 years old, own it for 3 years, then sell. I'd like to run this same calculation across many different makes and models of cars in order to find the ones where this period of minimal cost is lowest. (Then filter by other criteria of my choosing, such as which optional features each car possesses; though I'm comfortable doing that part manually with a few Google searches.)

To accomplish this I need data; lots of data. Hence my post here. Does anyone know if detailed information on the ownership costs of various vehicles is publicly available? Or am I out of luck? (I suspect I am, but I figured it couldn't hurt to at least ask before I'm forced to give up and make my choice in a less data-driven way.)",not_spam

I am looking for a large corpus of technical product descriptions to use in an ML project that I am working on.  An example of these kinds of data I am looking for might be like this NewEgg post for a coffee maker: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA1JX4754385&amp;ignorebbr=1

Specifically, I am looking for textual descriptions like the kind which can be found on the ""Overview"" tab.  Going with the example above: 

""The Knox KN-TKCUP Travel Size Single Serve K-Cup Coffee Brewer is designed for people whose hectic morning routines don’t allow time to sit and enjoy a pot of coffee. The KN-TKCUP quickly brews coffee using a disposable K-Cup so you can quickly fill your travel mug and get out the door without worrying about waste or clean-up.

Quick Set-Up with Minimal Clean-up
The KN-TKCUP uses single-serving K-Cups to brew coffee so there are no coffee grounds to dispose of or coffee pots to clean. Just fill the tank with up to 12 ounces of water, place a K-Cup in the holder, and press the power button. When your coffee is done brewing, all you have to do is dispose of the K-cup and you’ll have a hot cup of coffee to enjoy on your morning commute.

Save Money on Coffee
Traditional coffee makers that use pots are great if you need to brew several cups of coffee at once, but, if you only need to make a single cup, you’re going to end up throwing out a lot of coffee. K-Cups are ideal in these circumstances because they allow you to make only the amount of coffee you need so you don’t needlessly waste water and coffee grounds.""

I'm looking for 'natural' large graph datasets (hopefully labeled). By natural I mean datasets where graph is close-to-original structure (like karate graph or dolphins).

I want to avoid graph with adjacency matrix being similarity (or its approximation) matrix as I find those less 'natural' (sorry for that fuzzy term here)

"# Description

Every day, Public Health England release a dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases by English Upper Tier Local Authority. This dataset archives each day's release for download, and aggregates the cases by day into one file.

# Get The Data

[https://www.getthedata.com/covid-19/utla-by-day](https://www.getthedata.com/covid-19/utla-by-day)

# Usecases

The obvious usecase is to build confirmed case trackers for areas within the UK.

# Caveats

Public Health England is only testing a small proportion of the population. The true number of cases is likely to be many many times higher than they are reporting in their data.

"I have a hypothesis I'm trying to test, which is that ideas on the internet  are generally not very diverse. That is, even when there are opposing viewpoints, there are usually only a few views total on a given topic. So, I'm looking for **data sets cataloguing things like online newspaper articles based on the general ideas they present**. A hypothetical example would be a database on articles about the 2012 election campaign that catalogue them based on whether they mention abortion, gay rights, immigration, or job growth. In that case, I might be able to  demonstrate that the majority of election coverage centered on those topics, as demonstrated by the high frequency of those terms in online articles. 

Another example might be data from twitter or Facebook tagging posts by topic/key word. I could potentially demonstrate that social media activity is dominated by certain buzzwords.  I know that google has an n-gram search for books, but does anyone know of one for the internet or for newspapers?

There are plenty of other studies you could do; it doesn't matter much to me what the topic or specific material is. I also don't mind if it's a very small data pool.

The goal is to use the data the Flaredown gathers to identify patterns and correlations that might help patients of these hard-to-treat illnesses. For example:

- Does X treatment affect Y symptom positively/negatively/not at all?

- Are there subsets within our current diagnoses that could more accurately represent symptoms and predict effective treatments?

- Can we reliably predict what triggers a flare for a given user or all users with a certain condition?

- Could we recommend treatments effectively, based on similarity of users rather than specific symptoms? (like Netflix recommendations for treatments) 

- Can we quantify a patients level of disease activity based on their self-reported symptoms? How different is it from our existing measures?

So I was trying to get a number of people in each bracket for each suburb.


For some reason the sum of the people based on the percentage was not equal to the number of people given for each suburb

the issue was that some of the suburbs added up to 100.1% which man not sound like much but was causing as much as 332 more people to ""exist""

"I downloaded monthly data from the Refinitiv Eikon Datastream, dating from the 01.01.2002 to the 01.12.2021. 

For the variable ""price"" I obtain 239 observations.   
However, I am interested in the  ""opening price"". For which I obtain only 212 observations. 

The 27 singeltons missing are allocated on the 1st or the 9th month of a year.  
01.01 missing values: every year 2002-2021, except 2005 and 2011.   
01.09 missing values: 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 

I guess that the 01.01 has no opening price as the stock market has holidays for the New Year's Day.   
Moreover, I guess that the 01.09 has no opening prices in some years because it is labor day in america? Could that be possible?   


Despite the reason for the missing data. I need the data. Other providers, like yahoo finance, have opening prices for each single month in the same time period. 

Unfortunately, I need to use the Refinitiv Eikon Datastream, as I rely on further variables like ESG Ratings which I can only access there.   


Does someone has an idea how to download opening prices for each month using Refinitiv Eikon Datastream ? Is there maybe an option to take the next days opening price in case there is no data for the 1st of the month?

"Hey everyone,

Happy Friday! Hope you're all hanging in. We are looking for advice on how best to promote a data science competition we're running right now over at: [https://www.proptechchallenge.com/nyserda-tenant-energy-data](https://www.proptechchallenge.com/nyserda-tenant-energy-data)

As background, large NYC office buildings saw their occupancy rates drop by 90% on average last year due to COVID-19, but their energy consumption only dropped by 30%. While lease obligations and healthcare protocols contributed, there is still surprising room for previously unknown vampiric loads within these buildings. We now refer to this circumstance as **the Great Energy Disconnect**. 

Rather than leave it to the usual suspects (NYC building owners, managers, and their consultants), **the PropTech Challenge aims to democratize access** to the Great Energy Disconnect. Our website has **over 2.5 years of real-world data** from a Midtown Manhattan office building and the headquarters of a publicly traded tenant available for download. 

We are challenging data scientists and modeling enthusiasts to use our test set to **predict actual electricity consumption** in this headquarters on 8/31/2020 (the day after the test set ends). **Submissions are due by March 26, 2021** via upload on our website. The most accurate, eligible predictions will **win $5k cash**. 

Our test set has been downloaded **over 75 times by teams in 35 cities and towns on 5 continents** so far. We'd greatly appreciate your advice and assistance doubling these figures before our deadline! Solving the Great Energy Disconnect is crucial if New York is to achieve its climate leadership goals. Please join the fight!

"Following, and attempting to improve upon, [this model](https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-speaker-recognition-using-transfer-learning-6fab63e34e74), I am creating a data set to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify speakers by scraping LibriVox. In the original work, the authors used 45-minute audio clips from 57 unique speakers. These clips were trimmed into pieces with an individual duration of 5 secs, and the spectrograph for each piece was found. This served as the training set for an image-classifier CNN. The authors cited resource constraints for their choices. 

I have acquired 981 unique readers with varying runtimes (tens of minutes to hours) and have access to multiple large supercomputing clusters. I am trying to determine the optimum way to pre-process this data in terms of runtime limitations and duration of the pieces.  Are there any obvious pitfalls of using 20 ms pieces as I've seen in other models? Should I stick to a set total runtime for each reader  (e.g. 45-minute clips)?

# My goal is to catalog, parse, and analyze the properties of misinformation campaigns on the internet.

It is very difficult to address a problem if you don't understand the full scope of the issue. I think most people are aware that there is a lot of misinformation out there, but they think that its relegated to the crypts of the internet and they are not effected by it.

It's not. It's EVERYWHERE. And you've touched it.

I don't think blind censorship is the solution. It is a quick fix that just creates a temporary inconvenience, as Parler has showed us, and does nothing to stop the actual campaigns.

I won't lie to you and say *I* have the answer right now. I don't. But I do know where to start, and that's with some good questions:

* How many platforms are actually hosting and distributing this content?
* What channels are utilized to reach users? How is the content found by users?
* How much of the content is organic vs manufactured?
* How many people does this content reach per day?

The answers will shock you! You may literally be electrocuted.

Please check out my post on /r/ParlerWatch/ if you want to contribute or get a list to mine yourself!

I am doing this manually at the moment to get a rough picture of the situation, and could use your help! I need to itemize things like subreddits, facebook groups, twitter tags, news sites, etc, which serve to aggregate and disseminate misinformation content.

* `ship_from`: The place where the item is shipped from. This field could be null as shipping information isn't required for certain marketplaces.
* `ship_to`: The place where the item is shipped to. This field could be null as shipping information isn't required for certain marketplaces.
* `seller`: The seller of the item.

And if I can find data showing there still is an income discrepancy. Then his theory is disproven. He agreed.

&amp;nbsp;

Can someone direct me to where I can find this kind of data?

Height vs Income in tech sector (or Silicon Valley). My googlefu is not strong enough.

"# Reddit, Twitch, Deezer, and GitHub datasets for graph classification benchmarking

These datasets are useful for performing binary graph classification. The related [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/karateclub) and the respective [Paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04819)

## GitHub StarGazer Graphs
### Description
The social networks of developers who starred popular machine learning and web development repositories (with at least 10 stars) until 2019 August. Nodes are users and links are follower relationships. The task is to decide whether a social network belongs to web or machine learning developers. We only included the largest component (at least with 10 users) of graphs.
### Link
* [GitHub StarGazer Graphs + Target](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/datasets/blob/master/graph_classification/git_stargazers.zip)
## Properties

## Possible Tasks
* **Graph classification**
## Twitch Ego Nets
### Description
The ego-nets of Twitch users who participated in the partnership program in April 2018. Nodes are users and links are friendships. The binary classification task is to predict using the ego-net whether the ego user plays a single or multple games. Players who play a single game usually have a more dense ego-net.
### Link
* [Twitch Ego Nets Part I](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/datasets/blob/master/graph_classification/twitch_egos_1.zip)

"Hello frens,

&amp;#x200B;

I uploaded a [dataset of MRI Scans for brain tumor segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/brain-tumor-segmentation-in-mri-brats-2015). It is the training set for the BraTS competition for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. The data contains MRI scans and expert segmentations for HGG and LGG (high grade and low grade gliomas), as well as survival data. 

It can be used for tumor type classification, tumor segmentation and survival analysis.

Hope it helps,

I'm using it to assign users default time zones based on their connecting country code (something CloudFlare provides for free via a HTTP header called ""CF-IPCountry"") by finding all UTC time zones available for their country and selecting the time zone with the highest population as their default.

"# Interested in indoor localization? 

**Dataset available containing high resolution ground truth location labels.**

**Features:** Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) (dB), accelerometer (x,y,z) (g).

**Labels:** Actual participant location (x,y,z) (m)

**Time:** UTC format.

**Subject:** Human, four total, one per home.

The data are intended to evaluate RSSI based indoor localization  methods with activity measurements provided from a user-worn wearable  device. Location labels are recorded automatically using a small camera  which registers fiducial floor tags, placed at a meter apart, as the participant carries out their  normal routines in a natural way. There are some scripted fingerprint experiments (as a standard RSSI training schemes) in each collection but the majority of the data is unscripted.

Approximately **14 hours** of annotated  wearable measurements are provided.

A user wears a wearable device on their wrist, which records  accelerometer data at 25Hz. This data is transmitted, at 5Hz, towards a  number of Bluetooth Low Energy access points (8-11) within the home.  The access points mark the packets with a Received Signal Strength  Indicator (RSSI) measurement and the accelerometer measurements are timestamped.

"Hi, very niche question here but I am not sure where I can ask, pointers to another subreddit would also be appreciated :)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so I am not american and I'm trying to understand how the american census type data from the ACS works (total newbie about it). I pulled the data for Massachussets from the ACS website here:

[https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS\_pums\_csv\_2017&amp;prodType=document](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_pums_csv_2017&amp;prodType=document)

&amp;#x200B;

But I am more specifically interested in the [Greater Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston#Metropolitan_Statistical_Area_(MSA)) (aka the Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH MSA). Now I would like to know what are the PUMAs (Public Use Microdata Areas) for this specific MSA so I can extract only data for this region from the dataset. My problem is I am unable to find that information anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I can find the names of the counties that are part of the MSA on wikipedia and try to get the list of PUMAs from this names reference PDF:

[https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/puma/2010\_PUMA\_Names.pdf?#](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/puma/2010_PUMA_Names.pdf?#)  (page 20)

&amp;#x200B;

But a lot of the names in there are ambiguous and I would prefer to have an official list than guessing from a wikipedia page. I was able to find a list of FIPS place codes for the Greater Boston MSA, but as I understand it FIPS and PUMAs are not convertible into each other.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like this website manages to do it though:

[https://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US14460-boston-cambridge-newton-ma-nh-metro-area/](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US14460-boston-cambridge-newton-ma-nh-metro-area/)

So I assume this information is out there somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

" **Reddit**, I've taken some **time** to crawl the internet and **combine** my findings into a single collection to **share** with you all. I'm going to post this around in various places because I **believe** that this should be shared with as many **individuals** as possible. 

* I made sure to crawl a **large** variety of websites and eliminate any duplicate files (I did this via checksum not filename and kept the longest file name). However **there**'s a large amount of files  that aren't as descriptive as others due to the way they were hosted and the way the page **displayed** the track data. While a humungous amount of these are clearly obvious, some may not be, just a warning!

* That *being said*, this is the largest midi collection on the internet spanning numerous repositories past and present. I've done a lot of work to crawl hundreds of sites, download their entire publicly available midi (I didn't crawl **paywall** content but I've peaked behind and it's not much better than what's available in public), keep the best named uniques and organize them into a folder. 
* Genres include: Pop, Classical (Piano/Violin/Guitar), **E***D***M**, VideoGame, Movie/TV Theme

I made this collection with the intent of ensuring that a large amount of well created music wasn't lost due to the sands of time or the frustration of 5 file downloads per hour restrictions. I feel like all producers could benefit from having a profoundly large swath of midi files at their fingertips for inspiration, reference or remix purposes. This is a large collection, with a large amount of content creators, too many to reference here and their identities are generally impossible to know. Some will be spot on and miraculous; others will sound like total garbage. I didn't go through it by hand due to not having 15 lifetimes of spare time. You get to download the collection and taste de jour. 
 
This is a reference tool kit and like all things, is not flawless but does the job well. Also I discovered that many sites with impressive looking file counts don't even come close to their listed size; not all but most are running 1/10th of their posted file counts. Enjoy and make lots of music!

Please note that the Killed By Police page's says: ""Inclusion implies neither wrongdoing nor justification on the part of the person killed or the officer involved. The post merely documents the occurrence of a death.""

I have normalized the data by comparing it to the average annual number of murders in a state from 2011-2013, according to FBI stats. The numbers for 2014 are not out yet. So this data is 11 months of data compared to an average of the three previous years. That might make some stat heads shake their heads, I know.

So we are looking for company's that gather and/or sell big data on about user behavior on sites like youtube, google search, facebook, twitter, IMDB etc for the purpose of ad placement.

So dose any one know abut any vendors of this type?

Best, 
Jonas

"What are the legal aspects of publishing a dataset made of news articles scraped from a website?
I know the author (or copyright owner) can act against someone who reproduces his work without express permission, but in this case there are some differences:
1. Articles won't be totally republished (images and embedded videos and other such things won't be added to the dataset),
2. Articles won't be immediately usable from the general public as they will be serialized in json or csv format, and will not be organized in a way that makes searching for a specific article easy
3. There won't be promotion of the content or any form of profit from it
4. The source will be credited
5. The dataset will be made public with the sole intent of research (and points 2 and 3 might further indicate this).

"So recently I visited the website pay scale. On their college salary report and the highest pay jobs with a bachelor's degree. Its basically a list on how much each college major makes. That website reports that people who get a Business and Information Technology degree can expect to make around $60,000 dollars once they graduate. The website ranks the major 85 out of 827 different types of bachelor degrees people can get. For reference information technology ranks 223, management information systems ranks 95, and business administration ranks 409. They rank different majors based on how much people can expect to get paid from receiving them. 

1. I was wondering if anyone can tell me if it is worth pursuing on getting a dual major in business and information technology based on what that website says or is the dual major to broad?

 2. Would employers find it valuable if I got this dual major since I have skills in both IT and Business? 3. Career titles I want to go for are a web admin, IT manager, BI analyst, and search marketing strategist. Would this be a good double major if I want to break into these fields?

But I'm having great difficulty finding datasets for the students.

"Hello guys, apoligies if this is not the correct subreddit.

I am currently working on my Master's Thesis and I'm a bit of a csv novice.

I am in possession of a very large comma seperated csv file that contains a bunch of data i need for my analysis. The data is scraped from a website (kickstarter). However, the way the data is presented makes it hard to use for analysis.

The variables are as follows


Title | Goal | Amount pledged | Is Funded | Amount of updates | Title of update | Text of update | likes pr update | comments pr update
-----|----|--------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------------

However, in the culonm 'title of update', 'text of update', 'comments pr. update'  and 'likes pr update' the data is presented in a single cell e.g. ['20 likes','35 likes'] for a project with 2 updates.

I am looking for a way to present this better by seperating the observations into n-amount of rows, where n is the amount of updates, and the standard columns (title, goals and so on) are just empty.

I am dealing with around 50.000 projects so this need to be automated in some way. Can you help me?

Let me know if you need a screenshot or a sample uploaded

"... maybe not quiet but it seems that way. Here's the story: 

I am a cyclist, trying to do between 150 and 200km per week.
Since joining a site that evaluates all my power, heart rate data etc. I am being targeted by a Health insurance company for cyclists. 
One of their statements is that cyclists have a 

*28% lower risk of all-cause mortality*.

I've tried to look up the definition of ""all-cause mortality"" and it just does not make any sense to me. Surely they are not saying that I have an 28% chance of living forever. I've checked with a friend who is a doctor and one who sells insurance and neither could help. The website does not seem to quote any scientific articles that support this bold claim. 

So I am trying to find: 

* The evidence that this specific claim is based on. Failing that I'd be keen on
* finding an understandable definition of 'all cause mortality'
* finding similar research that considers the risks and benefits of cycling or sports in general, as I'm certain there are some significant health issues. ",not_spam

"Hi everyone,  
I'm wondering if something like this exists or if there's a tool I could use to closely approximate the experience of it. I want an iOS app that allows me to quickly time activities of different types and push the data in a very simple format to my computer when I want it.   
The experience I'm imagining is something like, I wake up and hit the wake up button. The app records when I woke up on this day. I go to brush my teeth and hit the ""start brushing teeth"" button, then the ""stop brushing teeth"" button when I'm done, and the app records when I started and stopped brushing my teeth on this day. Rinse and repeat this experience for things like eating meals, urinating, commuting, shopping, etc. I'd also like if some activities had other options added to them as well, like when I hit the ""stop grocery shopping button"" I add the amount of money that I spent on groceries or likewise for when I'm done eating out or something like that. Again, I'd also really like if the data were either remotely or manually pushed to my computer and separated by day so that months from now I can look at shit-tons of correlations and stuff.  
Does anyone know if anything like this exists?

"Hi folks, 

I was hope to try a few machine learning techniques for recognising offensive texts. I guess I'd define offensive in the corporate kind of ""not safe for work"" way, or say something that would make it on the Apple app store.     

Obviously it's easy getting loads of sets of texts, Twitter and what have you, it's just that these aren't separated in to what would be considered offensive and not. 

Reddit seems a good source, I was thinking maybe a few of the jokes forums. And then split the two datasets in to /r/cleanjokes and /r/meanjokes. I tried youtube safety filter on and off but there's been changes to the API and this doesn't work. 

Also, as this is an ML experiment obviously the more data the better. Millions of samples would be great.  

The second problem is I'd like eventually like to try this on multiple languages. Again, multilingual on Twitter is super easy, it's just the labelling that's the problem. Although I'm going to concentrate on English just to start.

Any thoughts on any of the above would be great.

I'm currently trying to find agricultural statistics for Taiwan from 1911 until present, basically just the area sown and the production of four main crops (rice, wheat, maize and soybean). I‘m particularly interested in the period under Japanese (1911-1945) and Chiang Kai-shek rule (1945-1975).

I have looked at the statistical yearbook published by Taiwan Statistics Bureau and there is a lot of missing data prior to 2000. Statistical books such as *Economic Statistics of Mainland China*, 1949–1957 by Helen Yin and Yi-chang Yin turns out to contain only national data.

A felt-presence experience is a feeling or sense that another entity, individual, or being is present despite no clear sensory or perceptual evidence.

Although many people around the world who experience these phenomena is high, information about these types of experiences has been relatively limited.

"Hello r/datasets,

I am currently working on a software solution for a new piece of hardware and have stumbled upon an issue with the data we have. 

I am looking for ""clean"" images of human iris'. When you search google for any manner of [human iris pictures](https://www.google.com/search?q=human+iris+macro&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqqemRqaHiAhW7HzQIHSHkCjgQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=656), you get 99% with one or both of the aberrations that come with photographing something like this.

1) Light reflection

2) Eyelash reflection or background reflection.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if there is a dataset of clean iris', ideally just the iris (the full iris, not portions of it) and not the entire eye with not aberrations? I am looking[for something like this](https://www.eyesight-foto.de/en/eyesight-iris-foto-galerie-2017/), but they only have several on their site. 

One of my colleagues suggested talking to an iridologist that [takes pictures like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=iridology+iris+pictures&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS721US721&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=isz:lt,islt:10mp&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXzfzVqKHiAhURpJ4KHT1ZAnwQpwUIIQ&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=656&amp;dpr=2.75). This is getting closer, but there are still aberrations in some of them. I did contact a few of them and they said they can't release without patient permission, or won't release at all even with permission because it is really 'weird'. I don't blame them one bit, it is pretty random.

I asked an optometrist too just as a long shot and she was pretty confused as to where to even start, but ended by saying she really couldn't help.

Additionally, there are different types of photography that can be used to image an iris, so this dataset  can be in regular images, infrared, or scattered-light photography.   
Any/all suggestions welcome.

Thank you!",not_spam

I'm stuck trying to figure out a way to create a dataset of car images where the images are the features and the labels are the angles at which the images were shot.

What is the data worth?

Is the data already ""sellable"" if there are only 100-500 users or do i need 10k+ users?

"Hi there! We've just added a new dataset to Gourdian, this one courtesy of Google's Project Sunroof. This dataset essentially describes the rooftop solar potential for different regions, based on Google's analysis of Google Maps data to find rooftops where solar would work, and aggregate those into region-wide statistics.

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_censustract#summary ), where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code#summary ), where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude/longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you'd like.

This dataset seems like it'd be interesting to cross reference with things like weather, and perhaps electricity prices, to find the best places for people to invest in rooftop solar.

"Hi everyone!

So a bit about my background – I have a graduate degree in engineering but currently work in a radically different field. At one point I was intimately familiar with Stata, R, and Matlab as part of my math and statistics courses, but unfortunately I have long since forgotten how to use them! I’m now tasked with analyzing data in a way I’m finding difficult because I don’t remember AT ALL how to use these programs. My point here, is that you can assume I know nothing about these programs, but I have the ability to learn (because I once did!).

I have two questions, but I’ll first explain the situation. I have some three hundred lines, each broken into sets of coordinates. Each line has something like 180 x-values and associated y-values. Each of these is in a separate sheet on excel. Not every line has the same number of coordinates. I have provided an example of some of the coordinates on one sheet for reference (reference #1)

Part 1 of my task is transferring each of the 300 lines from excel into one data complete set in Stata, R, or Matlab (your choice!). My first question is, how do I transfer this set of coordinates to Stata, R, or Matlab in a way that is conducive to being analyzed as I need in part 2? I’m not worried about efficiency as much as I am simplicity. If I have to perform the same action manually to each of the 300 sets to set up one master data set, I will do it. Would it be easier for me to copy and paste each line next to each other (as in reference #2)?

Part 2 of my task is to analyze these data. I will be performing several statistical analyses, but I’d just like help with the code/steps for the first example, and I can try to learn from there. As one specific example, I am interested in comparing the mean y-value of each set of those y-values associated with x &gt;= 22.9 to the mean y-value of those y-values below x = 22.9, and whether this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.5).

To break this example down for clarity, (as I feel wording can be difficult here) consider a method in two steps. First would be creating two new data sets from these 300 lines, each set with 300 means. One data set includes an average y-value for those y-values associated with x &lt; 22.9. The second data set is composed of the average y-values for every y-value associated with x &gt;= 2.9 in each line. The second step would be running a t-test on those two new sets to see if they are statistically different. What specific steps would I use to find this answer based on your proposed method of how I set up my data set in part one?

"I follow a bunch of stock market traders, each trading day they post and talk about a lot of tickers. I wish Twitter, like Telegram would allow me to export/scrape all the tweets tweeted by the accounts I follow for the specific day

Like if today is 2/15/2022, then I would want some sort of program that allows me to scrape all tweets made by the accounts I follow and  compile that list into some sort of .txt file whereby I can use a website like   [https://www.online-utility.org/text/frequent\_words.jsp](https://www.online-utility.org/text/frequent_words.jsp)  to find the most mentioned tickers from that .txt file if that makes sense.

Thing is, I am not really a programmer, just a trader, but I thought this sub would point me in the right direction. I don't mind finding someone on Fiverr to do this for me, but are their any free tools that do this you guys think? Also for a complete noob programmer, can I possibly learn to do this or would it be too difficult because of my 0 programming experience? If its possible to learn then please do point me towards the correct videos/websites that teach this sort of stuff.

Some basic reading showed me stuff like ""twitter api"" and I think this would be required no?",not_spam

How would you go about this, if there is no publicly available data? I already searched Kaggle and Google Dataset Search but to no avail. I only found either patrons with only numbers of checkouts or books with numbers of checkouts, but no relation between the two.

"I’m posting this in a few subreddits. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction. It’s something I need for a research project.

I’m looking to find data on data use (ideally the volume of internet and phone data generated and circulated, but also the number of smartphones, number of internet connections, anything that might help).

Even better would be the amount of data collected and recorded (by google, or by facebook, or by data analytics companies etc). That’s what I’m mainly interested in. Also, anything that might help me tell whether the two are interchangeable – as in, if I can’t find the amount of data collected can I use the amount of data generated as proxy?

It would have to be as local as possible. So US states would be fine, but cities would be even better. Data from anywhere in the world would be good, but US or UK would be best. And it would have to be free and publicly available, since I can’t afford to pay a data analytics company to give me their data.

Thanks!

"Dear all, 

I'm working in clinical research, all the data we collect in clinical trials are in CDISC format (SDTM and ADAM). Now, in my free time I'm working on a personal project publicly available on github. I would use some sample data to test it but I'm not sure where to find them.

Do you have any idea where can I find some clinical trials data? I'm aware of how sensible are these data but there are some clinical trials which are totally publicly funded and the data should be open (like EPIC study). 

Possibly they should already be in CDISC format, but in the case they are not I'll do the porting by myself.

"I've found some data by searching this subreddit, but I wouldn't mind more comprehensive data or the things I'm still missing.

I need data on:

\-US Presidential Election popular vote results, by county, including 3rd parties, independent candidates, and write-ins, from 1980 to present.

\-US Electoral College vote results by state/DC, including faithless electors and accounting for possible split votes in the cases of Maine and Nebraska from 1980-present.

\-Classification of US counties as rural/urban (other terms, or more categories being included like suburban is fine) 1980-present. Data on urban/rural status of metropolitan statistical areas, or population estimates of municipalities would also be useful.

\-US voting eligible population estimates, 1980-present, by county, preferably yearly, but if not possible estimates in years of presidential elections, or in census years would still be useful.

\-US population estimates by county, 1980-present, total population is fine but population over 18 (voting age population) is preferred.

Any set including more than one of these points, going back further than 1980, or that is only part of the information on one of these points (only part of the time frame, only specific states, et cetera) would be useful, although obviously more complete data is preferred.

"Hello there,

I was looking for interesting datasets and I found the dataset of [Number of International Visitors to London](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-international-visitors-london). I downloaded it and now I have a doubt, which I could share with you and try to clear as much as possible.

The xls file contains some sheets. Assume I select the 'By country' one. In the row regarding Argentina, in the first column (year 2002) I see 14,6 as value (that's rounded up).

Now, I can't understand it. The header says ""Visits (000s)"", so I think those values are thousands? I mean, that 14,6 becomes 14600? Plus, there is some ambiguity on using the comma: in the UK the . symbol is used as a decimal mark, thus I think the aforementioned value would be 14,600.00, right? (fourteen thousand and six hundred)

I know that maybe this is a *silly* question but I can't understand it alone!

once again I neeed to seek help from my beloved community. 

I am writing my master thesis and I cannot advance further. I have a problem with the dataset I download using the Refinitiv Eikon Datastream add-on for Excel. 

Mainly the prices from the dataset are wrong. I don't know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am using 2 datasets, which I merge. One dataset including stock prices, market value and ESG ratings. The other i downloaded from Kenneth French website and includes the Fama-French factors and the riskfree rate.

I run the CAPM regression to start with. I regress the excess returns, calculated from prices, on the market return, given by fama and french.

Firstly, I used daily data. With daily data I obtained good results. However, I want to change to monthly data for a couple of reasons. Using monthly data I obtain no significance. 

Therefore, I downloaded the monthly stock prices for a couple of firms from yahoo finance. Using those I obtain significant results again. 

The monthly prices differ slightly, but sometimes result in very varying returns. How can that be?

"Every so often we hear about a large set of passwords being hacked and that there exist lists of passwords that have been leaked over the years.  These lists are in fact used by many cracking programs first before resorting to brute force methods.

I have found one such list in the past and used it to see whether any of my *supposedly* `hard` passwords were present.  I can not find this type of information anymore.  I want to do an analysis of the characteristics of passwords in general, but I need this type of list - __the newer and more complete the better__.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

The samples they provide look reasonable, and it comes in at 1/5th the cost of: http://greatdata.com/zip-codes-lat-long


Additionally, the Zip-Codes.com dataset includes attributes like population and income, which could potentially see some business use as well.

"API Endpoint:  http://stream.pushshift.io

This will return SSE styled events for all new comments and submissions (99.99% of the time in correct order -- still QA'ing this part).  

Please let me know if you notice any issues.  Eventually I will have parameters to only stream submissions or comments or specific subreddits.  The event type is either ""t1"" for comments, or ""t3"" for submissions.

Event data is a JSON string.

**Parameters**:
-------------------------------------------------------

*If more than one parameter is specified, they are treated as OR operations.  Meaning that if you are filtering on the subreddit ""askreddit"" and also on the author ""automoderator"", you will get both in your stream.

**subreddit**: Include any submissions or comments with this subreddit in the stream.

**author**: Include any submissions or comments with this author.

**over_18**:  Restrict returned submissions (""t3"" events) to either NSFW(over_18=1) or non-NSFW (over_18=0)

**event**: Limit to only comments or subreddits.  Values are ""t1"" for comments and ""t3"" for submissions. (i.e. event=t3 to get only submissions)

**match**:  Does a regex on the body (comments) and title or self_text (submissions).  Limit in any way you want.  (i.e. match=subreddit"":""askreddit for only askreddit comments and submissions -- case insensitive).  If you search for ""star"", it will match start.

**start_id**:  If you lose your connection to the stream and want to reconnect at a specific id location, pass the start_id parameter and the stream will replay from that id until it goes real-time.  The stream buffers the last half hour of all reddit activity.  Use the last processed event id.

**previous**:  Get the last X events starting from the current event.  In other words, if previous=1000 is passed, the stream will give you the last 1,000 events in order and then resume in real-time mode.  Max value is 100,000.

**Examples**:
---------------------------------------------------------

     wget -qO- 'http://stream.pushshift.io/?subreddit=askreddit'

**Filter only comments or submissions from the subreddit askreddit**

    wget -qO- 'http://stream.pushshift.io/?author=""automoderator""

**Filter only comments or submissions from the author automoderator**

     wget -qO- 'http://stream.pushshift.io/?event=t3&amp;match=imgur

**Show submissions that contain imgur anywhere in the JSON response**

    wget -qO- ""http://stream.pushshift.io/?event=t3&amp;over_18=1""

**Get only NSFW submissions** *There is an underscore between over and 18.  It should be over_18*

    wget -qO- --header='Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate' ""http://stream.pushshift.io/?event=t1&amp;previous=10000"" | gzip -dc

**Stream the previous 10,000 events using compression (saves bandwidth) and then resume in real-time.**

**Notes**
-----------------------------------------------------------

The timeout is set to 600 seconds.  If you filter by something very esoteric, the stream could disconnect after 600 seconds.  Please be aware of that.  The timeout resets for any activity.

Also, there can only be one active stream per IP address.  If you need more streams, we can talk.  

**Edit**:  Working out a few kinks -- consider this to be in beta for the next week while I continue to QA this under load.  Thanks!

**Edit 2**:  When using a start_id that is behind the most current id, the stream will deliver content 100 times faster until it catches up.

**Edit 3**:  When using the previous attribute, you can now get up to the last **100,000** events!",not_spam

"Hi Reddit Users, 

I'm a graduate student working on my master's thesis in Educational Evaluations and Research. My topic for my master's thesis will evaluate how well state standardized tests for special populations (students with disabilities) measure intended proficiency targets.

The state that I live in makes it really hard for students to get access to any kind of department of education data. So I decided to put a blast out to the reddit community to see what states provide non-aggregated standardized test data (specifically item level responses to each question) on their website. Or even states that make it fairly easy for students to obtain their standardized test data.

If anyone has any advice that could steer me in the right direction, I would be forever grateful!",not_spam

"[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), a Natural Language Processing startup has just release the  v1.2 of its text datasets library with:

* 611 datasets that can be downloaded to be ready to use in one line of python,
* 467 languages covered, 99 with at least 10 datasets
* efficient pre-processing to free the user from memory constraints.

Repository: [https://github.com/huggingface/datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

From the [README.md of the repo](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets):

🤗Datasets is a lightweight python library providing two main features:

* one-line dataloaders for many public dataset: one liners to download and pre-process any of the 611 public datasets (in 467 languages and dialects!) explorable and searchable [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets). With a  command like squad\_dataset = load\_datasets(""squad""), any of these datasets is ready to use in a dataloader for Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX,
* efficient data pre-processing: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the above public datasets as well as local datasets in CSV/JSON/text files. With simple commandes like tokenized\_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize\_function) a dataset is efficiently prepared for inspection, evaluation or training of a predictive model.

"A lot of data is inaccessible to the general public, and for good reason. Electronic health records are absolutely abundant, but due to the risk of identifying an individual and due to the culture/laws around health information (HIPAA). One company is looking to address this, [MDClone](https://www.mdclone.com/). Their technology links to large data pools and produces totally synthetic data. The data retains the same core statistical properties, but none of the observations represent a real person. For this reason, research using these data are generally IRB exempt and at some point it may be acceptable to make these data public facing.

So, if you had free rein to analyze some clinical phenomena, what would it be? How would you like to see this technology used?

"Hi guys, I just found this subreddit while looking for a dataset for my assignment and I thought maybe you guys could help me. For uni I have to make an assignment in R with a dataset that fits the following description ""it should contain at least fifty observations, one categorical and one continuous variable."". I have already made the assignment before, but sadly I failed it. And after the trouble I had finding a dataset last time I thought it maybe easier to ask people who know more than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Other criteria for this assignment are to be able to perform a test statistic (t or z test) by hand and perform a linear regression test using R. The latter made me fail the last assignment so if anybody knows the command for that, it would be much appreciated.

"Hi there! We've just added a new dataset to Gourdian, this one courtesy of Google's Project Sunroof. This dataset essentially describes the rooftop solar potential for different regions, based on Google's analysis of Google Maps data to find rooftops where solar would work, and aggregate those into region-wide statistics.

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_censustract#summary ), where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code#summary ), where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude/longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you'd like.

This dataset seems like it'd be interesting to cross reference with things like weather, and perhaps electricity prices, to find the best places for people to invest in rooftop solar. If you have any other ideas of what it'd be good to combine with, let us know, and we can try to prioritize ingesting those!",not_spam
"Good afternoon wonderful data people.  

The CDC now wants to study LA, DC and Chicago to understand case spread and new cases by neighborhood due to new hot spot designations.  The data we need is being posted daily here, for example, in LA County:

http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/locations.htm

But we don’t have the very important associated analytics and historical trends and graphs day over day from when the pandemic started to easily see what specific neighborhoods are being most affected and growing the most for new cases.  LA County adds to the neighborhood numbers daily, but they do not provide any sort of historical visualization or graphical trends.

If anyone out there feels they can do this, can you pull historical data by archive or waybackmachine and provide a graphical representation of new coronavirus cases by neighborhood for LA and potentially DC and Chicago as well?  This will get shared a lot in research circles some of us have access to and currently there isn’t a good site anywhere I have found that is tracking new case growth or decline or stagnation by neighborhood in the top three hot spot counties of most concern to the CDC.  This will also help residents in these areas as well.

"I have put together a zip file of all comments and submissions made to Reddit during the election period:

    UTC 2016-11-07 00:00:00 until UTC 2016-11-10 23:59:59 for submissions

The reason I included an extra earlier day for submissions is so that comments made at the beginning of the dataset can still (mostly) be properly linked to a submission.

All data like score information was removed because these comments and submissions were collected within a few seconds of being submitted.  This means that fields like ups, score, gilded, etc. are not included since they would be useless.  

I am making this available to academics and dataviz people who are interested in seeing how Reddit reacted during the election period.

"I am requesting articles (particularly op-eds) written by US Vice President Michael Pence for use in a personal text mining project.

The only thing that is known about the article is that it was written by a senior official in the Trump administration. I want to test this speculation by using statistical clustering (kmeans, decision tree) to see if there is any correlation in writing styles between the recent op-ed and what he has written in the past.

"Hello - I'm looking for a database with an API that provides information on US companies, their divisions (if any) and the brands (if any) sold by the company or its division.  Ideally, the database would cover more than just companies that sell consumer products but also provide services (e.g. airlines, rental companies, etc.)

From my research so far:

The bar code scanner databases are close; however, they only cover companies with products.  Further, they generally provide the product information and the manufacturer information.  Not infrequently, the manufacturer of a product is different from the company that actually owns the brand.

The trademark databases like WIPO have too much signal to noise and aren't a practical solution.  (There is too much overlap between similar trademarks.)

An example - if I were to type in ""Ben and Jerry's"" the database would show it is a division of Unilever.

Also - if people have a recommendation for other subs to cross post to - that would also be appreciated.

The **GDELT Conflict Dataset** may help us investigate this question. [Get it on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/vladproex/gdelt-conflict-events-1979-2021) 

It is extracted from the [GDELT events database](https://www.gdeltproject.org/). From their website:  


&gt;The GDELT Event Database records over [300 categories](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf) of physical activities around the world, from riots and protests to peace appeals and diplomatic exchanges, [georeferenced to the city or mountaintop](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html), across the entire planet dating back to January 1, 1979 and updated every 15 minutes.

The GDELT Conflict Dataset leverages GDELT to examine the evolution of conflict in the past 40 years. It aggregates information on more than 83 million events extracted from media reports in 258 countries for the period 1979-2021. The events are grouped in 32 categories describing conflict actions at various scales, such as \`Confiscate property, 'Carry out suicide bombing', 'Occupy territory'. Events are aggregated by event type, year and country, for a total of 176k rows.

So the Five Factor Mindfulness Scale is divided up between:

* Observe

* Describe

* Act with Awareness

* Nonjudge

* Nonreact

And I've measured the five factors combined into ""Mindfulness"" as well.

So I mostly put out this questionnaire to get an idea of internal validity. The Five Facets are fairly distinct from each other, except that it seems that Nonreactive people tend to also be Nonjudging.

A few of these questions are really weak. As an example, ""I am easily distracted"" only has four correlations greater than 30%, and only one greater than 40%: ""When I do things, my mind wanders off and I'm easily distracted.""--which is a similarly weak question. There definitely doesn't seem to be any reason to keep both questions.

It's possible that this 39 item questionnaire could be shortened significantly without any real loss. I'll be using a shortened version in the future.",not_spam

So I scripted Blender to generate a synthetic dataset for 600 unique lego parts with multiple parts per image resulting in **900,000 labeled class instances!**

**Download it here:** [**https://www.kaggle.com/dreamfactor/biggest-lego-dataset-600-parts**](https://www.kaggle.com/dreamfactor/biggest-lego-dataset-600-parts)

What's cool about this dataset:

* It's the largest publicly available LEGO dataset for object detection
* Uses SoTA domain randomization techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap
* Cheap to generate more data with [DreamFactor](https://dreamfactor.newnoetic.com)

"I saw some interest on Reddit about the DOJ's press releases from their Breifing Room located here [https://www.justice.gov/news](https://www.justice.gov/news). I wrote a Python script which crawled the site and downloaded the content of 13,087 releases going back to Jan 2009. Could be interesting to see changes over time.

The data contains:

1. Release ID
2. Title
3. Content
4. Topics (if any)
5. Components (agencies, departments - if any)

Sometimes the Release ID was included in the post text so they left it off as a field. The files are stored as newline delimited JSON. Meaning each line is a JSON record representing a single press release. Looking forward to any work people do with this!

I am currently trying to find a decent dataset on used cars. I would like to not only have information about the car itself (make, model, mileage) but I would like to have consumer report data as well (how often was maintenance, things broke, etc etc) on that same type of vehicle. 

My goal is to determine the cars with the most “reliability.” I am still not quite sure what key metrics I will deduce that from.

"Hi there,

I have two data sets and see something interesting going on, but I want to check if I'm doing it right. I am looking at population from the American Community Survey 5 year estimates (2017) and also at the 2017 LEHD data from  [https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/](https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/) . I am looking at a small area in Grand Rapids.

So the ACS data, which is all residents in the study area, shows that this area is primarily composed of black and Hispanic-identified people. (about 70-80%%). The jobs data from LEHD, which is composed of all workers, shows workers to be mostly white--about 70-80%. This is feasible since the overlap on population (ie, workers who also live in the study area) is very low, something like 1500 workers out of 17,000 jobs. However, when I look at LEHD's output just for workers who live in the study area (and may work elsewhere), it is also heavily white and non-Hispanic.

In general, it really looks like there is a racial gap in terms of access to jobs and employment rates. Does anyone know how I might go about checking this and being sure?  I am thinking I need to do something with the margins of error for eachdata set.

hello all!  
i am currently doing an analysis of the data is beautiful subreddit over at r/dataisbeautiful for my BA of Media and was hoping to access some sort of dataset about it  


i was looking to see if anyone had crawled the subreddit before, or is willing to do it, to gather various data about the community 

&amp;#x200B;

i was hoping for some data about how many people post in a certain time frame and the engagement of posts, or just any data that could be useful for analysing the way that people interact in the subreddit 

&amp;#x200B;

this would be extremely useful, thank you!",not_spam
"We took the top 100 business / entrepreneurship podcasts, transcribed them, and ran them through an NLP algorithm (AWS Comprehend for now, looking to build our own in the future). 

This dataset is for 7/12/20-7/18/20 (last week Sat - Sun)

The synthesized data is in Airtable 

[https://airtable.com/shr6hOa7qoTpKi0ue](https://airtable.com/shr6hOa7qoTpKi0ue)

&amp;#x200B;

It categorizes key phrases of the audio transcripts into 9 different categories:		

|COMMERCIAL\_ITEM|A branded product|
|:-|:-|
|DATE|A full date (for example, 11/25/2017), day (Tuesday), month (May), or time (8:30 a.m.)|
|EVENT|An event, such as a festival, concert, election, etc.|
|LOCATION|A specific location, such as a country, city, lake, building, etc.|
|ORGANIZATION|Large organizations, such as a government, company, religion, sports team, etc. |
|OTHER|Entities that don't fit into any of the other entity categories|
|PERSON|Individuals, groups of people, nicknames, fictional characters|
|QUANTITY|A quantified amount, such as currency, percentages, numbers, bytes, etc.|
|TITLE|An official name given to any creation or creative work, such as movies, books, songs, etc.|

&amp;#x200B;

Each of the topics has the top 20 results, except in the few cases where we removed duplicates (It counted Instagram and instagram as two different topics for example). This avoids the really long tails of single keyword mentions. 

The ""Top 100"" comes from Chartable's top 100 podcasts for the business / entrepreneurship category based on the apple podcast data out of the U.S. 

If this is interesting/cool/valuable for this sub I can post a new one here each week. What other categories do you think would be cool to do? I like the idea of financial news to add to trading algorithms but would be curious what comes to mind.",not_spam

"This dataset are about Nafion 112 membrane standard tests and MEA activation tests of PEM fuel cell in various operation condition. Dataset include two general electrochemical analysis method, Polarization and Impedance curves. In this dataset, effect of different pressure of H2/O2 gas, different voltages and various humidity conditions in several steps are considered. Behavior of PEM fuel cell during distinct operation condition tests, activation procedure and different operation condition before and after activation analysis can be concluded from data. In Polarization curves, voltage and power density change as a function of flows of H2/O2 and relative humidity. Resistance of the used equivalent circuit of fuel cell can be calculated from Impedance data. Thus, experimental response of the cell is obvious in the presented data, which is useful in depth analysis, simulation and material performance investigation in PEM fuel cell researches.

comment searches for any phrase or word within one second across 3+ billion comments.  API will allow developers to select comments by date range, subreddit, author and also receive faceted metadata with the search. 

For instance, searching for ""Denver"" will go through all 3+ billion comments and rank all submissions based on the frequency of that word appearing in comments.  It would return the top subreddits for specific terms, the top authors, the top links and also give corresponding similar topics for the searched term.

I was hoping that someone could help me interpret some of the data values in the report.

I read earlier this afternoon that 243 Million Turkeys were produced in 2016, but I'm trying to derive that value by plugging in the values from Beginning Stocks, Total Supply, etc, and I can't arrive at the 243 Million figure.  Does the numerical value represent another unit of measurement?  It's my first time looking into agricultural datasets, but I saw a few that noted that measurements represented a certain amount of ""Heads"".

"The DARPA XDATA program is pioneering a new model of agile software development to support analysts working with big data. XDATA is developing a number of cutting edge software applications and components to address timely challenges in data science and intelligence analysis. DARPA has made these applications free and open to the public available as a downloadable [open catalog](http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/XDATA.html) of reconfigurable, open-source software components. XDATA is inviting analysts from the defense and intelligence communities, law enforcement, the private sector, and the public at large to download and use these open-source applications and underlying code. Building a community around the XDATA software catalog can help shape future versions of these applications through use and feedback. The applications developed by XDATA in 2015 address the following challenge problems:

1. Mapping, predicting, and characterizing population movements within and between cities and regions

2. Cross-dataset dealiasing to identify the same entities across different datasets

3. Financial event detection, such as identifying evidence of market manipulation 

**Operation XDATA: A Public Event**
Through this site you can also learn how to volunteer to participate in Operation XDATA, which is a large-scale research program managed by Draper. This research is designed to evaluate and improve XDATA applications. As part of this research you will be able to use XDATA application with large data sets to complete challenging tasks. After using these applications, you can download them and their underlying code for your own purposes. More information about testing can be found below in our formal call for research participants. You can also find this information on our study portal (click “Register”) at [http://xdataonline.com/](http://xdataonline.com/). Please feel free to forward this announcement to others that might be interested!

**Call for Research Participants**

The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain kinds of interfaces and analytic tools affect your analytic workflow. This study is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Your participation will include providing information about your basic demographics, personality, analytic abilities via online questionnaire. This will be followed by a testing session to be completed at your convenience through our online testing portal. During the testing session, you will be asked to participate in a variety of tasks, questionnaires and cognitive tests, as well as interactive tasks on a computer. 

**Eligibility Information**

Participation in this research is open to any persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years, that are not incarcerated (i.e., prisoners) or a member of another legally protected population (i.e., intellectually handicapped, children, etc.), with the exception of pregnant women (the procedures and materials used in this study do not limit the participation of pregnant women). You may be excluded from participation if you do not have sufficient formal training or experience in interpretation of data, hypothesis testing, or construction of reasoned argument to effectively answer questions about analytic process or participate in laboratory tasks. Ideally, potential participants have at least 3 years applied or working experience within an analytic vocation (e.g., intelligence, military, legal, business, marketing, credit, banking, finance, and capital markets, etc.), OR post-graduate training within a relevant area of study and associated analytic skills (e.g., economics, behavioral sciences, statistics, political science, etc.), OR have had relevant internships, post-doctoral, or research experience. However, should you feel that you meet the requirements given your applied experience, we will consider eligibility on a case-by-case basis. 
 
**Additional Study Details**

Study Duration:  Your participation in this study can involve up to 3 hours of your time: approximately 30-60 minutes to fill out online questionnaires, and 90-120 minutes as you engage in online analytic tasks. Additional follow-up tasks with similar content may be solicited, with your permission. Each of these are estimated to take between 90-120 minutes.

*Participant Involvement*:  Participation involves both completion of the online questionnaires and online tasks, which involve using next generation analytic tools to solve difficult analytic problems using complex data sources. However, participation in the online questionnaires neither obligates you to participate in online analytic tasks nor guarantees that you will be invited for follow up tasks.
 
*Compensation*:  Participation is strictly voluntary—there is no monetary compensation for participation in this study. However, participants being recruited from university research sites may be eligible for course/research credit commensurate with their participation as per their institution’s guidelines. 

To register as a participant or just to learn more about this unique research opportunity, please navigate to [http://xdataonline.com](http://xdataonline.com/), and click ""register"". You will be able to view more study information at this site as well as view our Online Consent Form. If you acknowledge the terms in the consent form, you can register a unique, but anonymous username that will be used to keep track of your data.

"Hi, I am trying to create an application that estimates the amount of a specific vehicle in a general location.

I haven't been able to find much, but any dataset that contains vehicle information (make, model, and year) and general location. The more specific the location the better.

I was able to find some datasets that I retrieved from data.gov and they are from the State of Maryland. These datasets varied from car crashes, traffic violations, stolen cars, and towed cars. I would like more data, specifically from Colorado but I haven't been able to find any. The datasets that I get will serve as a sample for the application. I realize that this may not be the best approach and it will be inaccurate, but this is just to estimate the amount of a specific vehicle in an area so I'm not looking for it to be 100% accurate.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I just joined this thread and saw a lot of questions like 'is there any dataset XXX with specific condition YYY (i.,e past 20 years, specific region KKK, etc) here.

just wondering if there is any dataset trading market? if not, why yet? (may be too rough question).

I know there are a lot of publicly available datasets provided by big tech companies, governments and research labs, but these datasets mostly for general cases and I guess there are/will be a lot of dataset demands for edge cases as AI industry is getting specific. For example, if I need tennis swing coach machine learning trading data from swing/serve data today, I am not sure that is something easily accessible.

What if there is such platform enabling person or companies to trade the data set with fancy dataset filters? would there be a lot of needs? the platform can provide well-organized filters/download/upload toolsets as a middle man.

"Update: as I find out more, I will update this post at the bottom.

Most of the data I can find is scrubbed and I since I don't have government access I'm not sure if this is a pipe dream.

What I want to do is to link together multi-generation families from just after the civil war (1870 census) and select out families considered poor at that time and then trace those families through public records to the current times.  In the end, I would like to have samples from at least all 48 continental US states with relatively high certainty of accuracy linked to wealth.

This is part of a proposed socio-economic project attempting to link wealth, education, vitality/health and social stratification across generations but it has so far been difficult to get sufficiently complete data to key together census data with birth records in order to link the available data.

Note: I could do it with names and addresses using probability since I don't need a high volume result, just a high probability one.  

Parts of the answer:

# Updates and progression on this:
## Similiar Project (different data and goal, but very very similar data needs)
* WSJ Article by Andrew Van Dam *What Southern dynasties’ post-Civil War resurgence tell us about how wealth is really handed down* [Article Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/04/how-souths-slave-owning-dynasties-regained-their-wealth-after-civil-war/)
* * WSJ Article Source Material: Leah Boustan of Princeton University [Link To Paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25700?utm_campaign=ntwh&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntwg2)

## Relevant Datasets and sources
* [USGenWeb Transcriptions](http://www.us-census.org/inventory/) - Very limited coverage, but broad partial coverage.
* [Census Dataset API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)
* National Archives Datasets [AAD Links](https://aad.archives.gov/aad/series-list.jsp?cat=GP22)
* National Bureau of Economic Research (Used in and co-authorship of the working paper cited above.  [Datasets](https://data.nber.org/data/)
* IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) [website](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/about.shtml) - recommended by u/EnochWalks in this thread.",not_spam

"So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler (and prettier) to actually enter the data. Are there any easy (no complex coding skills required) solutions for this? 

In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match (the same three players). The data gathered is (for each player)- 

 \- Character selected

 \- Rank

 \- Kills (including WHO they killed)

 \- Damage Given

 \- and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K/D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the 'kills' are shown as something like ""J2D1"" if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the 'enter kills' screen to automatically show two icons (J and D for N, N and J for D, etc) that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. 

So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It's totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it'd make a cool design project for my design portfolio. My programming skills are rudimentary though, so I'd rather use something that doesn't require too much advanced programming skills...

* Most vessels over 300 gross tons must transmit an [Automatic Identification Signal \(AIS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System), which is detectable from space.

* We are specifically looking to work with businesses, government organizations, and academic researchers and institutions.
* The hardware is complete, and will launch on a SpaceX vehicle this summer.
* When the hardware is installed, checked out, and operational, we will begin offering the data to evaluators.
* After the one-year evaluation period is over, we intend to commercialize the platform.

"Hi there,   
Following up on the Shopify App Store Insights - 2021 I posted a few weeks back. I've produced a similar report for the Chrome Web Store.   


[https://newsletter.marketplaceapps.co/p/chromereport2021](https://newsletter.marketplaceapps.co/p/chromereport2021)  


In the report I uncover insights across all Chrome Extensions. From the extensions by category, median and average ratings, downloads by category and much more.   


Check it out hopefully it'll have some useful info for you!   


Thanks

"Do you know of any publicly available datasets from industrial equipment? 

I have worked on several projects, but the data is always proprietary so it's hard to share the results.

I'm looking for data to use for applications of machine learning to industrial machine &amp; equipment health? Ex. Using sensor data to train a model to classify failure modes or predict remaining useful life.

I have found several hyped up marketing pieces, but very few real-world examples.... even fewer where the dataset has been made public so that you can repeat their results.

Here are the best two papers I've come across... Know of anything similar?

"I've got a good custom scrapper in python for the rental market in my area but I've been procrastinating on finishing the project. I need to validate every post manually and compare it to similar posts to flag reposts (but it's not all similar posts are reposts since management companies will often have near identical posts for distinct units)

Is my only option to write a flask app if I want a nice visual data browser to go in and validate all my data? I already relate all similar posts during the scrapping so it just needs to display 1 post at a time from the list that have a false in the manually checked col. I need to be able to edit all the fields and view the saved pictures and it needs to display the list of similar posts somewhere on the screen with just the relation confirmed col editable.

Right now the stapler saves to sqllite and the pictures col is a relative path/name but that can be changed if needed.",not_spam
"Hi, 

I'm a statistician who would like to access the musicbrainz database (especially all songs from 1964 to 1976) for a personal project, but I'm having really hard time to access the postgresql data in order to SQL querying it.
I can't access through pgAdmin the virtual server I mounted on my mac with virtualbox, as [advised on their website](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Download). PgAdmin keeps asking postgres user password when I'm trying to connect to the virtual server, which doesn't make sense to me.
  
Is there a way to import the [dumps files](http://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/20161026-001834/) directly in pgAdmin without mounting a virtual server ?

We're developing the strategy as of now, but it's always best to have input from the consumer on these matters, which leads me to the following question:

Which way do you go about searching datasets? Do you use the data marketplaces already out there (like Quandl), or you search a niche dataset provider to buy data from directly?

Since we're currently compiling the data there is, I can't really put my finger on which datasets are available; some of them got lost throughout the years. What I know for sure is that there is quite a lot of Amazon data for specific niches, datasets on multiple aggregator sites, like job aggregators, and SM data.

TL;DR: What's the best way to monetize datasets, taken from the approach of availability to find, as well as trustworthiness?",not_spam

"I am currently teaching an applied statistics course, and will therefore at one point also cover multivariate analysis. For this, I thought it could be fun to demonstrate the power of some of the techniques with real life data.

Any suggestions for a dataset that would be interresting analysing would be highly appreciated.



Also as a side note. I have heard rumors that there existed a dataset consisting of the answers to some seemingly random questions, together with the gender of the person replying. That if analysised with e.g. a BDT could give a quite significant separation of gender.

However, I found that people have used a large dataset coming from South Korea - there have been mentions of it in papers like:

"I miss baseball, but luckily there are lots of full games available to watch on YouTube and other third party sites. I want to watch games not *knowing* the outcome, so when the YouTube thumbnail says “WALKOFF BLAST!” right there, that’s a spoiler I wish I could avoid. But I also want to watch exciting high-scoring, competitive games, which I quantify by the number of runs and lead changes. “Trout 5-for-5 at Yankee Stadium” or whatever does not qualify as an exciting game in my book, and neither does “Sale with 15 Ks” or something like that. Even a game where a team is down for 8 innings then has a 9th inning comeback is not what I’m looking for, I just want lots of lead changes throughout. 

I’m not sure if my idea is even possible, but basically I would like to somehow create a data set, maybe in the form of a spreadsheet. Hopefully data is available be pulled from Baseball Reference or something, let's say from years 2016-2019. **This spreadsheet would rank games by number of total runs scored and total lead changes.** Record of teams does not matter. Time in the season does not matter. Outcome of the game does not matter, and ideally the spreadsheet would *hide* that information so I don’t know who the winner is before watching. 

This spreadsheet would provide me with a list of what I would consider the most fun games to watch, so I could just dial one up online and watch it like new! How would I go about setting something like this up? Is it even possible? Is there an even fancier data visualization we could use than just a spreadsheet?

It must have gender and age information and ideally would have location and income information. Also, It must have at least 10,000 data points, 50-100 would be awesome! Bonus points for sets that include children. A smaller set that tracks participants from a young age would be excellent too.

"Hey guys,

I would like to visualize the flow of nutrition in our food.

    E.g. the cow eats grass, which contains 100g of nitrogen, 50g of nitrogen gets shit out, 50 gram of nitrogen goes into milk, 10g lost during production of dairy products, 40 grams of nitrogen is found in dairy products, human etats 40 grams, shits out 30 grams  - of the 100grams which the grass contained, 10g stay in the body. 
Now imagine doing this not only for milk, but also for meat, cereals, fruit etc. 

It becomes a pretty complex diagramm pretty quick.  The program should also be able to adjust the whole sankey diagram if I change the input at the very top  (e.g. if I increase it to 110g, the 10g at the end would increase to 11g).

This is the closest example I found:

As we use Tableau, I tried using it, however, quickly realised that Tableau ist not made for Sankeys.

I came across some freeware where you have to enter each number individually, but this is not suitable for larger projects.

Quick idea: What if you had a dataset containing the nutritions and price of various food items? You could optimize your own diet!
Well.. now you can do exactly this! with the new dataset I uploaded to Kaggle.

You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/calculating-an-optimal-diet).

It contains nutritional values of household commodities. The dataset was used in the ""stigler""-problem where ones tries to figure out how to minimise the costs of food while still getting enough nutrients.
It has more than 230 household Items along with their Price, Nutritional properties and some other features such as the Unit size, Vitamins Content, Protein Content and more.

"We recently set-out to build a massive list of AI companies from around the world.  This was a dataset that included companies with just seed funding all the way to the likes of Amazon and Google.  
 
The information we put together included:
Company Information: address &amp; phone number
Products/Services offered: description of each product or service
Pricing: pricing information of the products or services
Classification: IOT, PaaS, Saas, etc
Customer List: Any customers listed on their site
Social media links: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook
 
After we finished pulling this information we started slicing and dicing these companies and here are some fun facts:
 
Our list was composed of 9983 companies in total.  
 
Social Media Presence:
 
                             Count
 
Facebook link      6213
Twitter handle     7212
LinkedIn link        8010
Instagram link     1299
Google+ link         2921
 
We expected LinkedIn to be the highest but what was surprising is the low presence on Google+.  
 
Customer names: If you ignore a few large companies like Amazon and Google most companies did not list any customer names publicly.  This was either because they did not have customers yet or did not want to disclose them.  In total we found 12,477 customers listed or only 1.25 listed per company.
 
Phone Numbers: Only 6211 phone numbers publicly listed on the website.  This was expected and mostly only b2b companies list their phone number publicly.  
 
An AI for everything: It’s a competitive market! For literally any AI you can think of there is a company out there.  There’s an AI that helps you find your next trip, one that helps you find a book (they claim better than Amazon does) and even one that claims to teach you math better than a tutor.  Still, the most popular of all are personal assistants.  If you are thinking of doing something in the AI world make sure to research in depth to understand your competition.
 
So many PaaS: Of the companies we reviewed almost 50+% were classified as Product As A Service.  
 
The big players: Companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft are all focusing on making it easier to get an AI up fast.  Their goal is to give you a plug and play style system..i.e servers you can spin up, image recognition and NLP apis you can hit.  The future here will be very similar to the world of cloud services - a few big players with slightly differentiated offerings
 
Most AI’s are still not that accurate: Now the coolest part of our job was actually testing many of these so called AI’s.  We say “so called” because we quickly realized that the AI was terrible.  Either the algorithm was totally off or their training dataset was not accurate enough...either way...most AI’s are still needed a lot of work.
 
Last question...why did we do this?
We wanted to build deep expertise on the AI market + we wanted to understand which companies most needed our help.  After seeing so many bad AI’s we now have a list of companies to contact.  Many of these companies have Data Scientists that can improve their algorithms, however, a crucial piece still missing is a super accurate dataset.  The first customer we picked up via this strategy we helped them create an emotion recognition AI that is 84%+ accurate.",not_spam

"Hi guys, I'm a student and have a big analytics project as part of a final. I'm very good at modeling and post-processing but am a bit weak at pre-processing. In order to make sure everything goes smoothly I'd like to make sure I'm correctly identifying datasets attributes as numerical vs categorical.

[Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ag3lAM-KbNjtwlXuMm8l6OkRwPRxI-lo/view?usp=sharing)

I've highlighted the attributes as per the classification I believe they are:

Green = Numerical

Yellow = Categorical

Red = Output

**My big questions regard attributes Q6, Q7, Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37.**

**Q6**: I believe this is **categorical** because hours seems to be on a scale of \[less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, more than 6 hours\]. If not for the scale (finite options for survey it would be continuous)

**Q7**: I believe this to be **categorical**. While it's a number, it may be categorical as it seems to be on a finite scale of \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4+\]

**Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37**: I don't understand these attributes as they're responses to ""Do you have any kids? - Yes/No \_\_\_"". On the surface they appear binary (Yes, No) and thus **categorical** but the max values for these attributes are 6, 7 &amp; 9 respectively perhaps indicating they are **continuous**. Perhaps you can infer what this really means. Perhaps it means for example ""Yes I have 6 kids that ride mountain bikes"".

What really throws me is when a subject indicates they have kids by entering a value for Q35 and/or Q36, but simultaneously indicates they don't have kids by entering in a value for Q37. As of right now I'm going with **continuous** (numerical).

Even a guess will really help me out.

Dataset from an attempt to teach computers to write silly poems, given a prompt / topic. 

I wrote a (surprisingly elaborate / painful) script to post each day's top news stories to Mechanical Turk, asking turkers to summarize each article as a haiku. I verified the syllable counts for each haiku against a syllable dictionary and/or manually (for unrecognized words).

It's been running since March. About \~2,000 people have responded and there are now \~2,700 haikus, forever memorializing the worst year of our lives, as punchy/gloomy sets of 5, 7, 5 syllables.

"Hi,

I'm looking for some publicly available individual level data from a longitudinal Randomised Control Trial (RCT).

I'm looking for such a dataset because I would like to investigate the properties in terms of power to detect effects, of using percentage change from baseilne, which for whatever reason appears to remain prevalent, in comparrison to more modern techniques which use all of the raw data such as mixed effects models which allow for repeated measures on individuals.  This is stimulated by previous work on this matter which demonstrated that percentage change from baseline is a less powerful approach[1]

My initial thought was that some sort of cardio-vascular drug that modifies blood pressure or related biomarkers that was tested using and RCT study design would be ideal but despite searching through this sub-reddit and various sources linked from [a Cross-Validated thread](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/7/locating-freely-available-data-samples/) I've been unable to find anything suitable.

I'm not wholly fixed on drugs that modify blood pressure, just something where there has been a demonstrable effect of the intervention within an RCT setting.  Its my intention to analyse the data using the approaches I mentioned above and to then conduct simulations based on the real data to test the power.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions,

"[cross posted on r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4l9d0t/nba_play_by_play_stats_with_real_time_not_game/)

Have any of you guys seen NBA stats records with the real time an event happened?  I'm not interested in the game clock - I'm looking for the time the event actually happened.

For example, if I look at the [play by play of tonight's GSW/OKC game via ESPN](http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400876754), I see that Stephen Curry scored a 1 pointer at the 10:27 mark of Q1.  With a game start of 6p PST I can estimate that event happened at 6:01:33 PM (1 minute 33 seconds after the start of the game), but I know it's probably not accurate due to game clock stoppages (time outs, commercials, official reviews, etc..).

Use case is to do some analysis for a data science class.  I've been searching around various sport stat sites but haven't tripped on anything yet.

Any pointers on where to find this or how to estimate it?",not_spam

"For a relatively long time, I have known about The Wayback Machine and I always just assumed I can get a past version of any website whenever I want. That is, until I actually needed to. I haven't started any actual work yet, but I want to train a model for detecting nsfw and racy pictures. I started thinking about getting the data first. So I figured, I should just download every picture on [victoriassecret.com](https://victoriassecret.com) since the site has been created, each download separated by approximately a week, and remove the duplicates, checking by name. To my unpleasent surprise, when I tried downloading the entire website on a particular day (using wget), I barely got anything. The homepage is archived [many times a day](https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.victoriassecret.com), with a total 32,417 snapshots over time. But individual pages have been archived maybe once or twice since forever. And even those pages don't have anything. What I could understand is that I was falsely happy about being able to access any website at pretty much any point of time using The Wayback Machine. It has made me sad enough that I don't want to believe it. Can anyone confirm that what I have said is true, so that I give up on getting data this way.",not_spam
"I have an idea to make a model to make suggestion on what channel to add to marketing mix, I'm wondering if people could read through and make any suggestions to improve it? Working with a company as part of my undergraduate course so may have the chance to test it in the field. 

The initial idea is to find a load of datasets that have clearly added a channel at a certain point in time, with a KPI value throughout the timeline. use some to test, some to train, then deploy the model is a live experiment for a digital marketing agency. 

**Training** 

3 months worth of touch point data (search, ads pixel and cookie data, email campaign, retargeting), with clear KPI e.g. daily sales, then 2 months in the company introduces a new channel e.g. display ads. the model then looks at the volume of sales before and after adding that channel, and comes out with a figure for how much that channel has contributed.

repeat the process for a bunch of data sets, until the model gets a 'feel' for how much a KPI increases when a certain channel is added based on the existing marketing mix, that would be training. 

**Testing** 

Do the same with test data, and make it predict how much of an impact on KPI adding a channel would have, then compare the prediction to the ground data (average lift in KPI after adding channel) 

**Validation**

Once the model is trained it would be able to analyse a dataset that (which could be visualised as a Markov chain), then based on what it knows from training and testing, it can make a suggestion on what channel to introduce or spend more money on. 

if the company took action on the prediction, it would be able to validate/invalidate that prediction.

Question 1) Is the above any good? 

Question 2) where can I find large multi touch datasets like this to use? 

 Any help would be super appreciated",not_spam

"I’m an undergrad that just started helping a professor with research. 

He wants me to improve his current method for getting/storing tweets. Right now, the program uses the search api and does some kind of recursive search on retweets/comments on news articles for top news outlets. The api is called with java and stored in MySQL.

Again, my goal is to improve it. My idea was to use the streaming api instead of the search api, dump everything into an amazon fire hose, store raw data in s3 and load into elastic search plus kibana as a UI. (Basically follow this tutorial https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-a-near-real-time-discovery-platform-with-aws/ )

The current program is logging about 35k tweets a day. Can anyone speculate if the proposed setup would be a significant improvement?

I know that speaking strictly data limits, the streaming api should have a higher capacity but I don’t how it behaves in practice. 

 I also no there are issues with time delay on the search api, and only getting a certain percentage of tweets with the streaming api. 

If anyone has experience with the api, I’d appreciate the advice",not_spam

"Does anyone know a big data set that contains information about the age of the parents of newborns including the babies gender. It does not have to be directly about it but should somehow contain this information.

It can be in the form of (gender baby, age mother, age father) or (persons gender, persons age, father age, mother age) or any version. As long as I can deduce the age difference between child and parents. So any additional information is irrelevant and can be included.

I'm not sure if raw, non-cumulated data like this exists publicly available. But if it is anonymised (especially it is doesnt contain any family structures and sensitive information) I see a possibility.

I didn't find anything that is super obvious or widely spread but maybe someone of you knows some data. There are of course plenty of websites that are publishing cumulated data in the sense of age structures - but no raw numbers.

I found the following [fantastic dataset on charge curves &amp; charge speeds](https://github.com/chargeprice/open-ev-data), but it doesn't include any info on 0 to 60, since the organization behind it focuses exclusively on building a charge planning app.

I could simply use a separate dataset for the performance comparison of my visualization -- it doesn't need to be wholly comprehensive.

"I was tasked with curating, creating, managing, organizing, ""hoarding"", internal, public, generated etc. ,datasets for machine learning, analytics, purposes. Would like to be able to make the datasets available, searchable, and somewhat organized.

1) Are there any currated lists of locations, sources access, source locations, of datasets and where to get them? So for example, anything that has a full list of just about every time of dataset that you could think of from twitter, to geography data, videos, audio recordings, census data, statistics data, etc etc. Almost like a curated /r/datasets with links, sources to everything.

2) What I am also looking for is a way of managing these datasets for internal datasets (along with public datasets). What I am looking for is tools, applications, software, or techniques for managing, organizing and making these datasets searchable at a high level so further analysis can be done. So for example, if someone is looking for tweets (maybe between in a certain set of dates, but at a minimum the dataset) and weather forecast data, they could search for twitter, find their information, grab or use it in place, and then search for weather forecasts and find that information.

We plan on having anything from images (machine learning datasets for validation and training), text (twitter, csv), video (cctv, not rips of movies), weather and geography, land plots, weather forecasts, weather information, traffic data, for the most part almost anything. What we feel we aren't interested in is having all versions of Ubuntu linux ISOs ever released.

"Lately I've become interested in figuring out how much positive equity a typical long-term homeowner has in their home, in both high-growth and not-high-growth regions. For example, in California the law prevents property tax increases, enabling people to stay in their homes even as prices go up. I'd like to examine this a bit closer, and try to understand how much equity homeowner who purchased in the 80's in, say, Mountain View, have in their homes.

&amp;#x200B;

So far the hard part of this analysis is not the existing home values... that stuff is everywhere. The challenge is figuring out how much of that value is eaten up by one or more mortgage. I believe I can do this one of two ways. One way would be a ""positive equity"" dataset. [Zillow has a great dataset](https://www.statista.com/statistics/460677/average-ltv-in-the-usa-by-state/) on ""negative equity"" but they don't include any numbers on positive equity! I'm not sure if this type of data exists, but it would be one way to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

The other way would be a dataset that contained loan-to-value (LTV) ratios by zipcode, county, metro or some other geographical factor. The closest I've come to this is [an FHA dataset that contains bands of LTV](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/Public-Use-Databases.aspx) ratios by metro statistical area. The geographic detail is excellent, but the bands are sort of broad and I'd like to be more precise.

Hi Guys,

I collected high frequency cryptocurrencies market data and uploaded them as.csv's to Kaggle. 
They include over 4 years of data for some of the most traded coins.

The datasets were collected using an automated collection pipeline that collected minute-by-minute market data for Cryptocurrencies and updated it every day to Kaggle!
The whole project took me a lot of time to develop and is not easy to maintain, so please if you find this of value: Your feedback &amp; support is highly appreciated!

This was mainly done for the cryptocurrencies forecasting competition that is currently in it's ""frozen stage"" where participants now watch their algorithms forecast the future and had not happen yet. (And hope for the best ;))


## Trading Related Kaggle Notebooks

Also, I also released **+20 example notebooks** that use the datasets for trading, each demonstrates a different approach for forecasting future returns.
This project is also beginner-friendly since it is highly documented, this can serve as a ""first stop"" when studying Time Series analysis.

I have been looking for this pricing for personal reasons, and found it incredibly difficult to identify where this information is located on each hospital's website. It seems like they bury it on purpose.  This kind of pricing should be easy to access and in one place for all to see.

Creating pricing transparency empowers consumers of medical services with a choice when selecting a hospital for elective or non-emergency procedures.  It's also a huge step forward in the fight to drive down medical costs in the US.

That's why I decided to explore creating an API and website that makes this information easy to access for consumers and engineers alike.  Is there any interest in this?

"Hey, folks of Reddit! 

**I'm in a dire situation. I need to complete my college project on artificial intelligence.**

But I'm so lost, I don't know how to build this as I don't have solid experience in A.I. I've only ever built apps and websites. 

**The project given to me is ""detecting seat occupancy using A.I""**

So for example, if I take a photo of 9 seats (3 of which are occupied by my friends), The A.I should be able to tell that 3 out of 9 seats are occupied. 

How can I go about doing this (where do I even get the dataset for starters)? I can some grasp terms in deep learning since I've played around with it a tiny bit. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",not_spam

"Hey all!

I'm doing research this summer and I need help finding some data. I need the most current data possible on average measurements for American females, aged ~18-30. I found [this data](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm) but it seems a bit out of data, and I was hoping someone could find something a bit more recent. 

The parameters I am looking for include:
* Height
* Weight
* Bust
* Waist
* Inseam

Obviously I don't need all of these, but as many as possible would be lovely. I feel like this data should be easier to find, but I am having trouble. Can anyone give me a suggestion where to look, or find some current data for me?

Thanks ahead of time!",not_spam
"Hi all,

We create datasets by taking pictures of specific objects. eg, footwear, home appliances and personal devices, shelves in grocery stores, waste on the streets etc.

Orders come unevenly and sometimes our resources are overloaded, but sometimes it’s idle and we want to use this time to collect the most requested data. What data is most relevant for you?

Also I’d like to ask your opinion about our service in general. We collect and label datasets. The collection and annotation processes are managed, to ensure that you will receive images in the required quantity and quality. We grant perpetual licenses for commercial or non-commercial purposes. What flaws do you see in our project? What should we change, remove or improve?

We are here: [tagias.com](https://tagias.com/). Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",not_spam
