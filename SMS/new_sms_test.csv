 Lewandowski, Wojciech, 2018, ""Replication data for: The Spanish completive reflexive: Idiosyncratic, motivated or both?"", [https://doi.org/10.18710/4QHOBK](https://doi.org/10.18710/4QHOBK), DataverseNO, V1, UNF:6:tokJXAhE3MEy0uanXSF5aQ== \[fileUNF\] 

&amp;#x200B;

**Description**:

Many researchers seem to think that construction grammar posits the existence of just wholly idiosyncratic constructions or form-meaning pairings. However, this idea demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of the approach, since constructions rarely emerge sui generis. Rather, construction grammar aims to balance the fact that some linguistic uses cannot be fully predicted from other well-established uses, with the fact that extensions of a construction, while not predictable, are motivated by other senses in the constructional network. This study illustrates this tenet of constructional approaches to language by providing an analysis of the Spanish completive reflexive marker se. In order to identify the different senses of the completive se-construction I used data from the Spanish corpus CREA (Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual, http://corpus.rae.es/creanet.html). Given the large size of the corpus (200 million words), the frequency search—which is merely indicative—was arbitrarily limited to constructions in which the verb appeared in 3rd person singular and was directly followed by a direct object headed by the determined articles el ‘the’ (masculine) or la ‘the’ (feminine) in singular. The data set includes all the instances of the completive reflexive found in the sample described above. (2018-10-17) ",not_spam

So the Five Factor Mindfulness Scale is divided up between:

* Observe

* Describe

* Act with Awareness

* Nonjudge

* Nonreact

And I've measured the five factors combined into ""Mindfulness"" as well.

So I mostly put out this questionnaire to get an idea of internal validity. The Five Facets are fairly distinct from each other, except that it seems that Nonreactive people tend to also be Nonjudging.

A few of these questions are really weak. As an example, ""I am easily distracted"" only has four correlations greater than 30%, and only one greater than 40%: ""When I do things, my mind wanders off and I'm easily distracted.""--which is a similarly weak question. There definitely doesn't seem to be any reason to keep both questions.

I have two data sets and see something interesting going on, but I want to check if I'm doing it right. I am looking at population from the American Community Survey 5 year estimates (2017) and also at the 2017 LEHD data from  [https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/](https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/) . I am looking at a small area in Grand Rapids.

So the ACS data, which is all residents in the study area, shows that this area is primarily composed of black and Hispanic-identified people. (about 70-80%%). The jobs data from LEHD, which is composed of all workers, shows workers to be mostly white--about 70-80%. This is feasible since the overlap on population (ie, workers who also live in the study area) is very low, something like 1500 workers out of 17,000 jobs. However, when I look at LEHD's output just for workers who live in the study area (and may work elsewhere), it is also heavily white and non-Hispanic.

In general, it really looks like there is a racial gap in terms of access to jobs and employment rates. Does anyone know how I might go about checking this and being sure?  I am thinking I need to do something with the margins of error for eachdata set.

"So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler (and prettier) to actually enter the data. Are there any easy (no complex coding skills required) solutions for this? 

In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match (the same three players). The data gathered is (for each player)- 

 \- Character selected

 \- Rank

 \- Kills (including WHO they killed)

 \- Damage Given

 \- and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K/D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the 'kills' are shown as something like ""J2D1"" if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the 'enter kills' screen to automatically show two icons (J and D for N, N and J for D, etc) that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. 

So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It's totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it'd make a cool design project for my design portfolio. My programming skills are rudimentary though, so I'd rather use something that doesn't require too much advanced programming skills...

Circular replacements don't contain these toxins, because most chemicals can't be recycled for the same purpose. All of them are far from mainstream because the companies producing/recylcing them are still small but I'm hopeful they'll grow rapidly with the rise of climate and health awareness.

I was hoping someone could assist me in finding a dataset that I'm sure must exist but I'm having trouble tracking it down.

I'm looking for something along the lines of ""Median Income by \[Neighborhood/Area\] in \[Niagara Region City\]"" and ""Population by \[Neighborhood/Area\]"" in \[Niagara Region City\]"".

I figure it must exist as I've found the data already mapped on [CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/maps/838?index=4#13/43.1708/-79.2444), but I'm looking for the data they used... if I look it up on CensusCanada they just have the general income/population data by city, without it being tied to specific areas of the city.

If anyone has any suggestions or could point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate the help!

"The data was collected from the music streaming service Deezer (November  2017). These datasets represent friendship networks of users from 3  European countries. Nodes represent the users and edges are the mutual  friendships. We reindexed the nodes in order to achieve a certain level  of anonimity. The csv files contain the edges - nodes are indexed from  0. The json files contain the genre preferences of users - each key is a  user id, the genres loved are given as lists. Genre notations are  consistent across users. In each dataset users could like 84 distinct  genres. Liked genre lists were compiled based on the liked song lists.  The countries included are Romania, Croatia and Hungary. For each  dataset we listed the number of nodes an edges.

* I made sure to crawl a **large** variety of websites and eliminate any duplicate files (I did this via checksum not filename and kept the longest file name). However **there**'s a large amount of files  that aren't as descriptive as others due to the way they were hosted and the way the page **displayed** the track data. While a humungous amount of these are clearly obvious, some may not be, just a warning!

* That *being said*, this is the largest midi collection on the internet spanning numerous repositories past and present. I've done a lot of work to crawl hundreds of sites, download their entire publicly available midi (I didn't crawl **paywall** content but I've peaked behind and it's not much better than what's available in public), keep the best named uniques and organize them into a folder. 
* Genres include: Pop, Classical (Piano/Violin/Guitar), **E***D***M**, VideoGame, Movie/TV Theme

I made this collection with the intent of ensuring that a large amount of well created music wasn't lost due to the sands of time or the frustration of 5 file downloads per hour restrictions. I feel like all producers could benefit from having a profoundly large swath of midi files at their fingertips for inspiration, reference or remix purposes. This is a large collection, with a large amount of content creators, too many to reference here and their identities are generally impossible to know. Some will be spot on and miraculous; others will sound like total garbage. I didn't go through it by hand due to not having 15 lifetimes of spare time. You get to download the collection and taste de jour. 
 
This is a reference tool kit and like all things, is not flawless but does the job well. Also I discovered that many sites with impressive looking file counts don't even come close to their listed size; not all but most are running 1/10th of their posted file counts. Enjoy and make lots of music!

I am looking for:

total workers / mean earnings / gender / ethnicity / industry / years of experience

I tried the Department of Labor, but all I could find is total workers / earnings / gender / ethnicity. I feel like it's not the full picture and it would be nice to see those deeper insights. Looks like PayScale did a crowd sourced thing, but I don't see a way to get to there actual data directly.

The links below are examples of how I've been collecting the data so far--one city at a time, often in pdf format--slowly an inefficiently.  In each case, however, the source of the cities' demographic data is the census.  

Is there single source or a systematic way I could get this same information for, say, the largest 100 US cities?

But, want I want to do is figure out the partisan lean for each of the new state house districts in Texas. This type of analysis is easily available for the federal districts at sites like 538 ( https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps ), but I want to do it at the state house level.

Then, as a second step, it'd be great to have the correct data to draw my own state congressional districts and derive partisan leans (as well as determine the racial makeup). But, this would be a much larger project for the future.

Anyway, I'm struggling to figure out where to even start. I could get precinct data from the MIT data lab, but state districts break up even precincts, so they wouldn't be totally accurate.

" Deezer.com 10,406,168 Artist DB

We have scraped the Deezer Artist DB, right now there are 10,406,168 listings according to Deezer.com

Please note in going through part of the list, it is obvious there are mistakes inside their system.

Examples include and Artist with &amp; in its name might also be found with ""and"" but the Albums for each have different totals etc. Have no clue if there are duplicate albums etc do this error in their system. Even a comma in a name could mean the Artist shows up more than once, I saw in 1 instance that 1 Artist had 6 different ArtistIDs due to spelling errors.

So what is this DB, very simple, it gives you the ArtistID and the actual name of the Artist in another column. If you want to see the artist you add the baseurl to the ArtistID

An example is ArtistID 115 is AC/DC

[https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/115](https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/115)

You do not have to use [https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/](https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/) if your first language is other than English, just see if Deezer supports your language and use that baseref

French for example is [https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/115](https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/115)

"Hi, As said in the title, I'm trying to make a list of countries by ""English speaking internet users"".

Two separate Wikipedia pages list the two statistics:

[List of countries by English-speaking population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population).

[List of Internet users by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_users_by_country).

But this only shows the amount of users of each language, not where they're from.

I want:

""List of countries by English speaking internet users""

---

Reason for the data? Countries have borders. But the internet is an international phenomenon. The main borders are language borders, with crossings in multi-lingual people, and tourists in internet translators.

It's pretty clear based on the data I do have access to (above data separately), that English Speaking Americans are the majority of internet users. They have over twice as many English speakers as second place India, and over twice as many internet users regardless of language.

This shows that the United States has the largest influence on the English speaking internet (obvious to most).

And this is the goal, looking at the influence different countries have on the English Internet.

---

India, it has the second highest amount of English speakers, and fourth highest on the amount of Internet users (hold your jokes please). Though the majority of their English speakers have it as an additional language, so that's probably why we see more British influence on the internet than Indian.

This dataset essentially describes the rooftop solar potential for different regions, based on Google's analysis of Google Maps data to find rooftops where solar would work, and aggregate those into region-wide statistics.

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_censustract#summary ), where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code#summary ), where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude/longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you'd like.

I am writing a research paper on the economic impact of the manufacture of certain items and I have chosen a violin bow. Something that seemingly is not very impactful but has many parts from many different places and has had some pretty drastic changes made to it over the years (ex. Ivory to ebony frog).

I have no idea where to look and have googled everything I can think of. I’m probably not thinking of something obvious but I need help. Thanks  :),not_spam
