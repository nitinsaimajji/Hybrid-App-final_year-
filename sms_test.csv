" Deezer.com 10,406,168 Artist DB

We have scraped the Deezer Artist DB, right now there are 10,406,168 listings according to Deezer.com

Please note in going through part of the list, it is obvious there are mistakes inside their system.

Examples include and Artist with &amp; in its name might also be found with ""and"" but the Albums for each have different totals etc. Have no clue if there are duplicate albums etc do this error in their system. Even a comma in a name could mean the Artist shows up more than once, I saw in 1 instance that 1 Artist had 6 different ArtistIDs due to spelling errors.

So what is this DB, very simple, it gives you the ArtistID and the actual name of the Artist in another column. If you want to see the artist you add the baseurl to the ArtistID

An example is ArtistID 115 is AC/DC

[https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/115](https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/115)

You do not have to use [https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/](https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/) if your first language is other than English, just see if Deezer supports your language and use that baseref

French for example is [https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/115](https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/115)

I am providing the DB in 3 different formats:

"I'm working on a stats project to test some of the skills we've learned in class on a real dataset. However all the datasets I'm finding, while interesting, don't meet the assumptions of any models I've learnt to use. The ones I've found require more knowledge than I have to analyse (stuff like very skewed, very zero inflated continuous data). I'm looking for a biological/ ecological dataset with a normally distributed response variable that I can model with a linear model or linear mixed model, or some basic GLM like poisson or binomial in R so I can get to practice some of the techniques I've learned. Can anyone give me any suggestions on where to look, or even what sort of data might be relatively simple to work with?",not_spam

"I want to do a Datascience project on failed retail store locations. My idea is to get a list of all active retail store locations for a specific, large chain (e.g. Starbuck, Marks &amp; Spencer, etc') and a list of all of their historical locations (all stores they ever opened), then mark the difference as ""closed""/failed stores. Even better would be some dataset with store level performance (i.e annual sales) but I can't find that. I need real world location (latLong is best), so anonymized data like Kaggle's Rossman store sales doesn't cut it. 

Any advice? I found datasets for all existing store locations (for, e.g. Starbucks), but nothing about historical locations (scraping wouldn't help for that. Ideally i'd love an existing dataset, not scraping). ",not_spam

I have a problem that probaly one of you can help me with. I am using IBM SPSS 24 and got a dataset which I am using for my research internship.

The dataset is from a Survey of Households and each case is a member under 5 years old of the household for this variable. I ultimately want to see wheter the differences in underweight between clusters, region and climatic zones in the country I'm doing my research on (Benin) significantly differs. Now I can ofcourse use crosstabs and examine the % per climatic zones (3), regions (12) and clusters (448) however i want to use them in a T-test so i need to have them as a variable.

I want to build a dataset for game tag descriptions. Could you please spare a few minutes to fill in some of them?

The idea is that a bot would be able to interpret game descriptions and associate it with game categories, for instance ""I would like to play a game where I drive a car"". Features that take place in each genre are also welcome as a description. If you want to write more than one sentece in one category, please use different slots. 

All descriptions must be in english and be short and simple. It is expected that everyone may have its own different description of a tag, this is perfectly fine. Even if you don't want to fill in all categories, it is fine if you write just a few.

This dataset contains the geolocation-based sentiment analysis data. The data is generated by an on-going project deployed at [https://live.rlamsal.com.np](https://live.rlamsal.com.np/). The geolocation data was extracted from the tweets which mentioned anything about ""corona"", ""covid-19"", ""coronavirus"" or the variants of ""sars-cov-2"". Complying with Twitter's data sharing policy, only the tweet IDs are shared. You can re-construct the dataset by hydrating these IDs. The tweet IDs in this dataset belong to the tweets tweeted with an exact location that contained any of the previously mentioned keywords.

The data is available in two formats: CSV and JSON. I'll be sharing new files every day, and the files will be named period-wise. For example, april28-april29.\* will contain tweet ID and sentiment data of the tweets that were tweeted between April 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020.

"Hey Reddit,

A few months ago, I asked a question on the forum - [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ekawho/how\_do\_you\_track\_and\_share\_your\_data\_reports/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ekawho/how_do_you_track_and_share_your_data_reports/)Based on your feedback, I and my friends have now built a free tool ([www.dstack.ai)] that can be used to publish, track, and share datasets (and data visualizations) via APIs from anywhere (a Jupyter notebook, a script or an application) and store them in the web application (which is also mobile friendly).  Very soon, we will bring a feature that allows you to download the datasets as well.

The current version supports Python and R as programming languages.

Here is a tutorial on how to use the library with the help of an example.

[docs.dstack.ai](https://docs.dstack.ai)  \--&gt; documentation including how to use dstack.[https://medium.com/dstackai/analyzing-the-speed-of-spread-of-covid-19-and-publishing-findings-on-dstack-ai-396cd588c867](https://medium.com/dstackai/analyzing-the-speed-of-spread-of-covid-19-and-publishing-findings-on-dstack-ai-396cd588c867)

I found a lot of dataset with labeled positive and negative tweets, but I also need neutral labeled tweets. I saw that Sentiment140 does not include neutral tweets and I had no luck finding a dataset like this.

I want to apply sentiment analysis to random user tweets, but there are lots of tweets with no sentiment value such as links etc. So I thought if I feed neutral data while training my neural network I can classify them as neutral tweets. I thought about removing tweets with only links in it, but there are other kinds of tweets that has no sentiment value too.

"Like fake news that panders to our human instinct of confirmation bias I'm worried about the spread of fake datasets intentionally crafted to dupe data scientists or spread disinformation. A possible example here: [https://twitter.com/derhorus\_x/status/1010118894219153410](https://twitter.com/derhorus_x/status/1010118894219153410)

Does this community have a protocol or a flair in place to tag such occurrences if they occur?

Edit: \`Fake News\` means different things to different people. Academically, it has been broken down into to categories: Disinformation and Misinformation. The 3 month old missing dog poster is misinformation if it was found shortly after the poster was hung up. Disinformation is intentionally crafting a message, a delivery medium, or false information with the intention of manipulating, deceiving, or crafting a person's worldview. According Eric Ross Weinstein's interpretation, Fake News takes the following four shapes: Algorithmic, Narrative,  Institutional, and factually false.

The same can be said about any form of information. Including a dataset. How a data is collected in a dataset can cause it to be slightly \`fake\`. A french politician a couple of years ago famously claimed in a stump speech that 100% of their middle east immigrants were criminals.  This is factually true if you believe that persons who cross the border seeking asylum as a criminal activity. Consider how if I wanted to convince you that anyone from California and New York is a rapist. I simply put a heat map showing the state of origin of all the convicted rapists in the united states. Clearly California and New York are rapists and should be stopped. We should build a wall to keep all the rapists out.

"So I'm not sure where to ask this, but this data sub is the only one I know of so I figured I'd try it here and see where it takes me...

So I am trying to gather data from a game that me and two friends play. I need to collect the following data from each game played:

\- First, Second and Third place person for that match

\- What character each person played in that match

Which isn't all that complex... but it makes it a little too much for a basic Excel sheet style table (or at least I can't figure out how to do it).

The best I've managed is to have it like the following:

&amp;#x200B;

||Person 1|Person 2|Person 3|Placement|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Game 1|Char1|Char2|Char3|123|
|Game 2|Char1|Char4|Char4|231|
|Game 3|Char1|Char 5|Char2|321|

&amp;#x200B;

Which.. I mean it saves the data. But it doesn't make it very easy to actually produce something at the end of it, especially as the 123/321 format for who got first/second/third won't translate into anything particularly useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Help pls? I'd like to be able to pull things like ""Person 2 has a 67% winrate when playing as character X"" or things of that nature.

Pretty openminded on this, but my initial searches are finding datasets that are way too restrictive for my non-medical background. Really hoping for ""here's 20,000 strains of DNA, and a set of attributes measure over their lifespan"". Since I believe most of our DNA is identical (just blueprints for proteins and organs and whatnot), the critical sections would be the most interesting. 

Also interested in looking beyond DNA to the various gut bacteria, what they feed on, and what they feed back to host. Interesting datasets could be low level (DNA, inputs, outputs) or more high level (Host DNA, gut bacteria DNA, quantity present, effect observed). 

Probably the most interesting datasets would concern embryo development, as the necessary memory array to simulate a fully grown human at the molecular level is roughly the size of the moon. Anything short of that is still outstanding, even if it's only a few weeks of gestation after conception, and whatever traits are observable from there.

"The data was collected from the music streaming service Deezer (November  2017). These datasets represent friendship networks of users from 3  European countries. Nodes represent the users and edges are the mutual  friendships. We reindexed the nodes in order to achieve a certain level  of anonimity. The csv files contain the edges - nodes are indexed from  0. The json files contain the genre preferences of users - each key is a  user id, the genres loved are given as lists. Genre notations are  consistent across users. In each dataset users could like 84 distinct  genres. Liked genre lists were compiled based on the liked song lists.  The countries included are Romania, Croatia and Hungary. For each  dataset we listed the number of nodes an edges.

"I work at a state park and the park manager has me and a coworker at the main entrances of two parks under his jurisdiction asking each car that enters what zip-code they are coming from. I don’t know the exact reason for this but I would assume it is Covid-19 related to send the data off to the state government. All he wanted me to do was to record the zip-codes on a piece of paper for him to send in at a later time but I figured that using excel to record them would be a much easier way to read the data in the end if they want to get nit picky. So I fired it up and I’ve never really used it before so I had to figure out some of the different simple functions to make it so I didn’t have to do a bunch of stuff in my head or calculate it. Then I tried to make it easy on myself and learn how to use the geography data type feature that is built in but couldn’t figure out how so I had to look up the towns associated with the zip codes one by one. Is there a more simple way for me to just have excel fill in the towns for me? Also I would like to make a heat map or something of the sorts showing the most popular zip codes coming to the parks but I think my college has blocked me adding the bing maps add-in to excel is there any other feature that is free which I could use to create a heat map of the zip codes?

I've never posted here before, so I apologize if this isn't the appropriate setting.

I'm working on an algorithm for a local animal shelter as a fun project to try to monitor respiration rates in dogs using only video. I've taken a test video with my dog to build out the algorithm, and I've tested it on myself and it works ok. I need to do a lot more hyperparameter tuning though, and I'm sure there are some edge cases I haven't thought of, so I'd really like to find a data set of videos of dogs sleeping.

I started trying to crawl YouTube for videos of dogs sleeping, but I've actually found it's surprisingly hard to find videos that aren't ""funny"" sleeping (i.e. just normal dog sleeping). 

I'm happy to work on building the data set myself, but I won't be able to easily take videos myself for around 6 months. I plan to label it by hand as well as I can then work on hyperparameter tuning once I've got a few dozen videos to work with.

Any suggestions would be really helpful! In the extreme best case, the data set would contain 1-2min videos in varied settings with varied breeds/ages/color dogs sleeping in a variety of typical positions.

The Yahoo News Feed dataset is a collection based on a sample of anonymized user interactions on the news feeds of several Yahoo properties, including the Yahoo homepage, Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Movies, and Yahoo Real Estate. The dataset stands at a massive ~110B lines (1.5TB bzipped) of user-news item interaction data, collected by recording the user- news item interaction of about 20M users from February 2015 to May 2015. In addition to the interaction data, we are providing the demographic information (age segment and gender) and the city in which the user is based for a subset of the anonymized users. On the item side, we are releasing the title, summary, and key-phrases of the pertinent news article. The interaction data is timestamped with the user’s local time and also contains partial information of the device on which the user accessed the news feeds, which allows for interesting work in contextual recommendation and temporal data mining.

The dataset may be used by researchers to validate recommender systems, collaborative filtering methods, context-aware learning, large-scale learning algorithms, transfer learning, user behavior modeling, content enrichment and unsupervised learning methods.

My Girlfriends birthday is coming up‚ and we both enjoy data. So I thought it would be a cute gesture to throw all of our messages to each other in a database, and use some form of Data visualisation tool (Probably mostly Tablaeu) to pull out some cool data.

I'm mainly curious if anyone has suggestions about how to structure the database. I work as a Software Engineer and have worked with Tableaueu before, so implementation shouldn't be too hard. But given what i'm trying to do i Imagine just putting each message in as a TEXT field is not best way to go about it.

I'm considering using MySQL, and think I basically want to create a structure where all unique words go into a lookup table and get their own ID, and then using a join tables between words and messages (possibly a table inbetween for sentences?). where the join tables which retains the order of words etc. But yeah any input on how structure to make it easiest to analyse the data later would be appreciated. 

And just to specify, the main goal here isn't to reach some specific final visualisation, the point is more creating the dataset, so something that for example automatically creates a word cloud is not really what I want. ",not_spam

"I'm looking for recommendations for a consumer purchase / preference dataset that consists of raw data of actual consumer behavior.

So for example, my ideal music dataset would be formatted so that each entry in the dataset is a list of the song titles that were liked by a single user. Then the algorithm would predict other songs that the individual users would like based upon the dataset.

My ideal consumer purchase dataset would consist of entries comprised of actual purchases by individual consumers.

So the gist is, I don't want any processing to have been done on the data beforehand - I just want the raw consumer data. 

For example, it seems the last FM dataset has already been partially processed, and I can't find the underlying consumer behavior that generated their dataset.

I understand this could obviously be proprietary, for good reason, but I'm hoping that there's some less competitive market where the actual consumer behavior is public.

As a close second, I'd settle for any type of discrete data that consists of labels.

"I'm building a comparative matrix for linear vs circular fibre based plate materials. Traditional linear materials such as MDF, plywood, gypsum, particleboard, etc. contain volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde which the materials release of their usage period. They're used in everything from ceiling tiles and walls to furniture, creating moderately toxic work and living environments. Circular replacements don't contain these toxins, because most chemicals can't be recycled for the same purpose. All of them are far from mainstream because the companies producing/recylcing them are still small but I'm hopeful they'll grow rapidly with the rise of climate and health awareness.

I'm interested in the peformance of these linear materials to determine the viability of replacing linear for circular in different regions around the world, though mainly in Asia. I already have the information for what I believe to be a viable circular material to compare them to.

 I'm interested in the following characteristics for the materials named mainly for the ASEAN regions (south-east Asia and Japan and China):

* Mullen test (breaking)
* Friction
* Bending point
* Fire retardancy
* Water resistance

"Hi everyone,

I'm searching for a dataset containing the mean monthly maxima and minima for US weather stations in recent decades. By this I mean the highest and lowest temperatures recorded during a given month (e.g. January), then averaged across all Januarys in the timeframe. I recently spent a couple days doing analysis on  [https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ushcn\_v2.5\_monthly/](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ushcn_v2.5_monthly/), only to realize they were reporting the average monthly highs/lows.

I've also tried to look through the NOAA search database ([https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search)) --- it does seem like they have what I'm looking for, but the low cap on station-years and the need to select stations manually to bypass it makes it very difficult to compile a comprehensive dataset.

Interested in recent decades, say the last 10-30-ish years, but can be flexible with specific timeframes. Could also compute the means myself as long as the dataset provides the raw monthly maxima and minima for every month in a certain period of years.",not_spam

"Hi data brains

I was wondering if anyone out there has generated .docx reports from data stored in excel?

I had thought to import the values using a mail merge type function, though the situation is a little more complex. I need to be able to do the following:

If (cell 1)=x AND (cell 2)=y THEN (use data from cell 3)

Any ideas about how I could do this? I have a feeling it might be a VBA or coding type problem (python?), though keen to hear if others have thoughts about it.

Hello
I want to build a twitter dataset for academic purpose. My focus is the anti ACTA campaign on Twitter. Therefore my initial idea was to extract all tweet with #ACTA from a certain period of time (January 2012 - July 2012). But apparently it's close to impossible to access this kind of data with the twitter API.

So another way I thought about was to select a population (MEPs, activisists) to extract their tweet with #ACTA. Would that be possible ?

Another question: I've actually received some pretty interesting results using the new Advanced Search for Twitter - where I can select the relevant field. Is there anyway to scrappe Tweets from those fields or would I have to do that manually?",not_spam

"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a [healthcare price comparison spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aDQsYvlM_6B2BH4JZ4WvSM4uUoAWfvYbmYaVrpoCew4/edit) my partner and I created.

Last year, we were doing a startup that found people therapists. Funnily enough, we pivoted because prices were so high and we didn't to make a luxury product.

Over the past few weeks it's become clear to us that people in the US have to spend increasingly out-of-pocket on healthcare even with insurance. From 2007 to 2017, the percentage of adults with employer health insurance on high-deductible health plans rose from 15% to 43%. For 2020, a high-deductible health plan is defined as one with a deductible greater than $1,400. Providers in certain fields, like therapy, also increasingly just don't take insurance. About 45% of psychiatrists don't take insurance, and in California about 50% of therapists don't take insurance.

Healthcare services prices are becoming very relevant, but we couldn't find a good price comparison tool. For example, I'm looking for a therapist myself, and I've narrowed my list down to 3 providers. The most expensive one is more than 200% of the least expensive one.

A couple of days ago we realized we actually have a decent amount of price data on therapists, so we decided to throw together this spreadsheet and see if it's useful for anyone.

We have about 120 verified prices that we confirmed over phone or email with therapists when we were finding people therapists. We also scraped prices for all the therapists in San Francisco from Psychology Today, the biggest therapist listing directory. (It's really easy to scrape them.) We also added any prices in bills we had access to, ours, friends', and family members'.

Note: you'll have to make a copy of the spreadsheet, and there's a tiny lag when using the dropdowns.

You can see a few interesting things. For example, we recommended the same therapists to multiple users and the prices were different. Prices also vary significantly from area to area.

We would love to make this more robust, so if you have any itemized bills for any healthcare service, not just therapy, we'd love to add them to this dataset! (Submission link in spreadsheet. We don't use your name, address, or contact information, so you can hide/remove any information like that.) We're also open to making it a web app.

Hopefully someone finds this interesting or useful! We'd love feedback, as well as if y'all shared any of your experiences paying for healthcare out-of-pocket or any comparison tools y'all are aware of.",not_spam

"Hello everyone,  

I need to download the hourly wind speed values from the great [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview) datasets.  
I tried using their dedicated python API as described in their [documention](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to), it does work, but the time needed to fulfill requests is insanely slow (about 10h for 1 day worth of data).

Sadly, I need the whole available period, over the global extent, and at several Z levels, at this rate it would take years to download :/

I guess the current ECMWF api is so slow because it subsets and formats the data before sending it to the client, but I don't mind doing those step myself.

So my question is: does any of you know about a direct access to this database ? maybe an HTTP/FTP server like the one NOAA provides, or a MOTU server like the rest of the copernicus service.

I did not find any other way to access their datasets, a user of this subreddit did build [its own API](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/i40z2o/looking_for_betatesters_for_historical_weather/) to fetch it, but I would like to get the data directly from the original provider, I would be surprised if ECMWF did not provide this kind of ""public but non-documented raw access"".

"I have a bunch of questions I'm seeking to answer, but I don't know how to obtain the data. I mainly want to learn if annoying alcohol laws increase or decrease the amount of small scale alcohol makers, and I think it would be easiest to focus on beer to answer these questions.


Example questions:

- Do restrictive liquor laws have any effect on the amount of entrepreneurs starting their own brewery/winery/distillery? (probably yes, they have at least *some* effect)
- Do they increase the amount of small scale liquor-making or decrease? (if it's more than a tiny amount, this will be very important to know)
- Do they have negligible/very minor effect? (this is what I'm actually expecting)

My main issues are:

- I don't know how to find a complete and detailed list of alcohol related laws by state
- I don't know how to use that information to rate states
- I especially don't know how to rate states by a meaningful metric of alcohol production, since my options include ""most new micro breweries"", ""best beers"", and ""most sales or pints/glasses/gallons purchased""

Perhaps I just need to find a ""top 5 common alcohol laws"" list and create a checklist?

"Hi everyone,

I'm introducing the ""War of Words"" dataset, a dataset of 450 000 legislative edits from the European Parliament. We extracted those edits from about 240 000 amendments contained in thousands of DocX documents. The data covers 10 years (2009-2019) and two legislature periods (the 7th and the 8th legislature). In each period, \~800 European parliamentarians proposed edits on \~1000 law proposals. The labels (*accepted* or *rejected*) correspond to votes on the edits by parliamentarians within the parliamentary committees, i.e., before forwarding the amended proposal to the whole Parliament.

The dataset is hosted here: [https://zenodo.org/record/3757714](https://zenodo.org/record/3757714)

I'm also releasing some [code](https://github.com/indy-lab/war-of-words) showing how to process and use the data (with a predictive model).

This is part of a paper ([*War of Words: The Competitive Dynamics of Legislative Processes*](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/275473/)) that I presented this morning at [The Web Conference](https://www2020.thewebconf.org). Here is a [video](https://victorkristof.me/video/war-of-words.mp4) of the presentation if you want an overview of the context and the structure of the data (and \[disclaimer\] some cool, early results :)).

The variable ""price"" has 239 observations for every company which is listed before 2002.   
The variable ""opening price"" has only 212 observations for every company which is listed before 2002. 

The 27 missing datapoints occure either on the 1st of January or the 1st of September.  
01.01: every year from 2002-2021, except for 2005 and 2011  
01.09: 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019

01.01 is the New Year's Day and the stock market is closed. Therefore, I guess no opening prices are available. However the ""regular"" price is available. How and why?  
01.09: Usually the Labor day been either on the 1st, 2nd or 3th of the respective year. Could that explain why there is no opening price?  


Despite the explaination for the missing data, I need data. Other data providers, like open source yahoo finance, do provide opening prices for each month of the same time period. 

However, I cannot use yahoo finance for multiple reasons. E.g. I want to analyse more than 5000 firms and I unclude some variables only provided by Refinitiv Eikon Datastream. 

Therefore, how can I obtain opening prices for each month? Is there an option in Refinitiv Eikon Datastream to do so? Can I somehow use the next days opening price if the data is not available?   


Thank you for reading.  
Best for you,  
Losyres",not_spam

"Hi, I'm Sumit Srivastava, founder of [Projell.com](https://projell.com/) . We made this after dealing with the data hell like low data availability, high data procuring cost, huge time sink for data collection, and privacy concerns over the user data. Think of it as AI Training Data Generator.

This prompted me to build an easy way to generate synthetic data for machine learning models. This primarily uses GANs, but we use techniques which are most efficient for specific usecases.

Areas where we've found it useful are biomedical, drone imagery, satellite imagery, retail, and autonomous mobility.

As already prominent in the ImageNet challenge, the state of the art is using synthetic data to gain higher accuracy. \[ [https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet) \]

Google, for their autonomous vehicles, used millions of miles of real driving data and billions of miles of synthetic data. It is clear where the world is moving towards.

"I spent a few days compiling but never had any time to do anything with it so I thought I'd put it up here and see if anyone wants to play around with it and get something meaningful out of it. I run a business that scrapes data from the web, but felt like doing this for 'fun' considering I'm a big aviation dork, and it's got nothing to do with my day job.

Early in November I scraped Ryanair's website for all their flights that they had published as of the date I started. Took about 4 days of continual queries (mostly to avoid getting IP blocked), and ended up with data on roughly 725,000 flights.

This was scraped in a series of steps from Ryanair - first was to query all the city combinations and get the dates for each flight. Second step was to then query each of those combinations and get the routings and fares returned. Ryanair does this through a series of easy to expose API's so it's just a matter of iterating through them enough time to get what you are looking for. Third was to take those results and aggregate them into a nice, clean output and blend it with some additional attributes and location data from [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/data/).

I did all of this using [FME](https://www.safe.com/), mostly because I love that tool despite my day-to-day job living almost exclusively in Python. I have linked my original workflows below too- feel free to use them to your hearts content. 

Here's whats in each file:

* **Date** - Flight Departure Date
* **Route Origin Airport** - Ryanair Airport Code
* **Route Origin Name** - Ryanair Origin Name
* **Origin_Airport Name** - OurAirports
* **Origin_City** - OurAirports
* **Origin_Country** - OurAirports
* **Origin_Airport Code**  - OurAirports
* **Origin_ICAO Code** - OurAirports
* **Origin_Latitude** - OurAirports
* **Origin_Longitude** - OurAirports
* **Origin_Altitude** - OurAirports
* **Origin_Timezone** - OurAirports
* **Route Destination Airport**
* **Route Destination Name**
* **Destination_Airport Name**
* **Destination_City**
* **Destination_Country**
* **Destination_Airport Code**
* **Destination_ICAO Code**
* **Destination_Latitude**
* **Destination_Longitude**
* **Destination_Altitude**
* **Destination_Timezone**
* **Flight Key** - Best I can tell is that this is the closest thing to a unique key that Ryanair published about each flight. 
* **Flight Duration** - HH:MM
* **Fare Key** - Similar to the flight key, this denotes unique fares found - these are not unique in the dataset though, they are repeated regularly
* **Fare Class** - Ryanair Fare CLass
* **Fare Type** - What type of fare, all Adult fares in this dataset
* **Fare Currency**
* **Fare Amount** - in the above currency, including any discounts
* **Fare Published** - 'sticker price', without discounts
* **Fare Discounted** - T/F if it is discounted
* **Fare Discount Pct** - percentage discount in the 'Fare Amount'
* **Fare Has Promo**

Something to note about 'segments' below. Most airlines operate routes that combine flights. For example, flying Air Canada from Vancouver to Copenhagen is considered one route, with two segments: Vancouver to Toronto, and Toronto to Copenhagen. In the case of Ryanair, it does not appear that they do multi-segment routing yet - although last I heard, there were plans to do so. 

* **Segment Number** - should be '0' for everything
* **Segment Flight Number**
* **Segment Origin** - should be same as above listings
* **Segment Destination** - should be same as above listings
* **Segment Duration** - should be same as above listings
* **Segment Distance (km)** - (NOT in nautical miles)
* **Segment Origin Time - Local**
* **Segment Origin Time - UTC**
* **Segment Destination Time - Local**
* **Segment Destination Time - UTC**
* **Request Time UTC** - Date/Time that the request for the segment/fare was made. 

Outputs were done in CSV, GeoJSON, and Tableau TDE. There is also a fun file called 'Original.json' which is the full JSON returned from the initial API requests if you want to look something up. As well, the FME workflows that did all of this are here too.

"[SECDatabase.com](https://SECDatabase.com) is proudly to share its internal SEC XBRL Financial Statement dataset with the community on a regular basis. The documentation can be found here:

[https://github.com/secdatabase/SEC-XBRL-Financial-Statement-Dataset](https://github.com/secdatabase/SEC-XBRL-Financial-Statement-Dataset)

**FAQ:**

**Q**: What is the data format?

**A**: It is in Parquet format, and optimized for AWS Athena and Redshift Spectrum

**Q**: How is this dataset different from [dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/sec-public-data-bq/sec-public-dataset) hosted on Google Cloud Platform

**A**: The dataset on Google Bigquery is based on Dataset published by SEC (See next question), and is stale - the latest filing data is as of June 2018.

**Q**: How the dataset is different from dataset on SEC website

**A**: This dataset has numerous improvements over the dataset on SEC website such as:

1. Text and notes data are in full-length without truncation. The dataset published by SEC trimed footnote to 512 chars, and string value to 2048 chars only.
2. Report segment information are added to the data points directly.
3. Include the start\_date and end\_date for each data point to reflect the period more accurately.
4. Eliminated the needs to understand the convoluted XBRL convention as much as possible, so that Data Scientist can focus on the data itself to derived the value.
5. Support the tracing of the data point back to its original filing and specific section.
6. Support the tracing of data point revision.

**Q**: Do I need to download the data to query the dataset?

**A**: No, you can use the Athena or Redshift Spectrum in your AWS to query the data directly.

**Q**: What is the coverage of the data?

**A**:  As of August 31, 2019, the dataset covers:

1. All XBRL filings since 2009.
2. 12.6k companies.
3. 239.7k annual and quarterly reports.
4. 192.5 million data points.
5. 20GB+ compressed in Parquet.

**REGISTER**: [https://forms.gle/TEFbySkQoPCJzs8H6](https://forms.gle/TEFbySkQoPCJzs8H6)

The dataset consists of 10K COVID English Tweets, including 4719 Tweets labeled as INFORMATIVE and 5281 Tweets labeled as UNINFORMATIVE, in which 8K Tweets are already released for training and validation. Although we provide a default training and validation split of the released data, participants are free to use this data in any way they find useful when training and tuning their systems, e.g. use a different split, perform cross-validation, and the like.

**Short intro (*****copied*****):**

The goals of our shared task are: (1) To develop a language processing task that potentially impacts research and downstream applications, and (2) To provide the community with a new dataset for identifying informative COVID-19 English Tweets.

This shared task is to automatically identify whether a COVID-19 English Tweet is informative or not. Such informative Tweets provide information about recovered, suspected, confirmed and death cases as well as location or travel history of the cases. To be able to achieve the goals of this shared task, we construct a dataset of 10K COVID19 English tweets. We believe our dataset and systems developed for this shared task will be beneficial for the development of COVID-19 related monitoring systems.",not_spam

"I'm building a comparative matrix for linear vs circular fibre based plate materials. Traditional linear materials such as MDF, plywood, gypsum, particleboard, etc. contain volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde which the materials release of their usage period. They're used in everything from ceiling tiles and walls to furniture, creating moderately toxic work and living environments. Circular replacements don't contain these toxins, because most chemicals can't be recycled for the same purpose. All of them are far from mainstream because the companies producing/recylcing them are still small but I'm hopeful they'll grow rapidly with the rise of climate and health awareness.

I'm interested in the peformance of these linear materials to determine the viability of replacing linear for circular in different regions around the world, though mainly in Asia. I already have the information for what I believe to be a viable circular material to compare them to.

 I'm interested in the following characteristics for the materials named mainly for the ASEAN regions (south-east Asia and Japan and China):

Material characteristics:

* ​Printing
* Mullen test (breaking)
* Friction
* Bending point
* Fire retardancy
* Water resistance
* Production Process

"Hi all,

This is my first Reddit post ever! I'm a rising senior looking to break into the data analytics industry and hopefully transition into the data science industry in 4-5 years. 

As you might surmise, I'll need to engage in projects where I wrangle, visualize data, and report insights from said data. To do so, I'll need datasets and I'll need to ask interesting questions. 

I'm new to the dataset world, and I came to share where I've heard to look for datasets, but also ask where you guys typically go to find data sets. (I know the place to go might vary depending on the kind of question I am asking.)

As per this article, [https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/04/best-sites-datasets-data-science.html](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/04/best-sites-datasets-data-science.html)? , and 10+ conversations with people who have been in the data analytics industry for 2+ years, I've learned to go to:

[https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
[https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)  
and [https://www.data.gov/](https://www.data.gov/) .

Have any other suggestions? Also, feel free to comment about your process of asking interesting questions about data sets. Also, feel free to drop a comment including an example of a real example of a data set you've used and some questions you've asked about them! My goal is to get exposure to others who've frequently worked with datasets and their processes.   


p.s. yes, my username is related to my real life identity. I like the idea of transparency on the internet!

"Right now, the FCC is planning to dismantle Title II net neutrality protections that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T from controlling what Internet users can see by throttling, blocking, and censoring sites and apps, or charging special fees that get passed along to consumers. Big Cable companies are pouring a ton of money into lobbying, misleading ads, and astroturf campaigns in an attempt to confuse the public. If they succeed, the Internet will never be the same.
 
**[We’re joining an Internet-wide day of action (like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown) on July 12th to help save net neutrality.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** 
 
Regardless of your political beliefs, this issue affects all redditors. Online communities like ours wouldn't exist without the principles of net neutrality that foster creativity and innovation on the web. We’ve worked together to defend the Internet before, now we need to do it again.
 
**Let’s have a conversation about how we as redditors can organize together for July 12th to make sure that decision-makers in Washington, DC listen to real Internet users, not just telecom lobbyists.** 
 
[Reddit](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15745974/net-neutrality-day-of-action-tech-companies) itself has agreed to participate in the day of action along with popular sites like [Amazon, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, GitHub, Mozilla, ](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/) and [Pornhub](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters). [30 other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) have already joined too. This is going to be big.
 
But there’s so much we can do together, from flooding the FCC and Congress with comments and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Learn more about the day of action at https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12 and let’s discuss in the comments!

There's plenty more work to do and thus, bounty to be won. The data from 2016 requires some cleaning. Where total vote counts are off a secondary source we need to figure out why and correct the data. As more states release precinct level data for 2020, that data needs to be added to the database. Some may have already released the data and a bounty participant can make a share of the bounty importing the data into Dolt right now.

For example, Maybe July 21st is the most common day because there is very limited snow so wartime travel is easier, or December 28th around the height of winter is more common because more historical figures died in winter. I would most likely not try to make one for Day/Month/Year combinations as that would be thousands of columns as opposed to 366. What do you think would be a reasonable number of records to limit the dataset to, if I end up having to limit it? Do you have any suggestions of better ways to do this?

"hello everybody, 

CONTEXT: FIFA football players dataset (soccer) involving 18000 players, information on abilities on a wide range of skills, alongside what team they play for, and their preferred position, and rating that they are given on the game fifa.

SO FAR I have separated the players into smaller datasets based on preferred position, and done a correlation matrix to see what is linked. Ratings seems to be correlated with certain attributes for certain positions (i know thats obvious). 

QUESTION: what next steps would you guys do in exploring this dataset and trying to find relationships between skills

I can only think of finding descriptive statistics, for example splitting the players in each position into three groups and seeing the differences in means, but that seems boring. 

over to you guys!

" Deezer.com 10,406,168 Artist DB

We have scraped the Deezer Artist DB, right now there are 10,406,168 listings according to Deezer.com

Please note in going through part of the list, it is obvious there are mistakes inside their system.

Examples include and Artist with &amp; in its name might also be found with ""and"" but the Albums for each have different totals etc. Have no clue if there are duplicate albums etc do this error in their system. Even a comma in a name could mean the Artist shows up more than once, I saw in 1 instance that 1 Artist had 6 different ArtistIDs due to spelling errors.

So what is this DB, very simple, it gives you the ArtistID and the actual name of the Artist in another column. If you want to see the artist you add the baseurl to the ArtistID

An example is ArtistID 115 is AC/DC

[https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/115](https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/115)

You do not have to use [https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/](https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/) if your first language is other than English, just see if Deezer supports your language and use that baseref

French for example is [https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/115](https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/115)

I am providing the DB in 3 different formats:

"Hi,

I recently did a web-scraping project on ArchiveOfOurOwn.org and collected every non-user-restricted work posted before 2020-07-17 as well as most of the work's meta data (such as tags). The dataset contains about 6 million works.

The dataset is stored in an sqlite database which is 502GB. Compressed the database file is 77GB and I'm distributing it as a torrent. The torrent file is uploaded here: https://gofile.io/d/E3rwvf

The intended use for the data is machine learning with the idea being that the set is large enough that even after narrowing it down with tags you still have a good amount of data. That said you can use it for whatever.",not_spam

"I'm looking for a way to scrape the public housing records in my area. I need to extract address, sq footage ect... I've tried several extensions and none seem to produce results in a workable format.
I have paid for similar thing from listsource and they seem to be able to produce what I'm looking for.

"I am looking for flight data for a few specific US/UK islands. I would prefer both historic and newly generated &amp; price. I want to track traffic in/out of these locations. Thus, an observation would be a single flight, air company, timestamp, price of ticket, location in, location out, ect. 

I think my best bet for historic prices would be some API feed, but I saw that Google recently shut down their QPX Express API and don't know of any alternatives. 

My other thought was to scrape the data. However, in this case I can only scrape data moving forward, I have to specify the location out of, location into, and specify dates --  presumably, there would then be assumed variability in price from differing locations, and being computationally more heavy having to query multiple dates each day the script ran. Additionally, I assume that prices may naturally increase as the script would then frequently be visiting a site.

"Hello, r/datasets. I'm currently working on a personal project where I'm monitoring my servers from a Wear OS smartwatch and checking it's workload for various parameters such as memory, per CPU usage, memory usage, swap usage, disk, and network usage, and a few more parameters.

This project is opensource and I'm actively developing on it for fun and keeping the project board up to date. My machines are:

* 6 laptop servers (4 cores + 16GB of ram each)
* 1 raspberry pi 3B+
* 1 machine that might be added later that's super old (2 cores + 1GB of ram? Not sure)
* A powerful GPU machine that I'll be getting in the upcoming months (??)

I sample these machines every 10 seconds (this metric might change), meaning that in a year, I'd have 21TB of data. I was initially planning on periodically deleting this data, but I wanted to know if this type of dataset would be useful to anyone or where I would upload it as a public service to the data science people knowing how hard getting data can be, and because I couldn't find a similar dataset like this anywhere else.

Currently, these servers don't do a ton of work because I'm usually busy with school + work + projects, but I intend to change that in the upcoming months by working on more projects and having work and to manage infrastructure.

Please let me know if this dataset is something that would be valuable to you, and what projects are you going to use for it.

Here's a [link to my GitHub](https://github.com/v2thegreat/Watch-Monitoring-System)[ Repo](https://github.com/v2thegreat/Watch-Monitoring-System) with the code for the servers + the App itself. Please Star if you think it's good! You can also follow the progress on the [project board here](https://github.com/v2thegreat/Watch-Monitoring-System/projects).

Oh, and I might include the workload that the server is doing at a given time, but I haven't implemented that yet

You can use `tail -f words.json` if you're on linux (or mac?) to have a look yourself once you've extracted the file. Here's an image of the prettified json: http://i.imgur.com/nmKJsBc.png

You can see that same definition with the API here: http://api.urbandictionary.com/v0/define?defid=9041433 Note that the `_id` property was added by me and can be disregarded. Ditto for the `lowercase_word` property.

Unfortunately it's missing the last year of data, because it was scraped in May 2016, but perhaps someone will be able to grab the last year's worth and throw them in the comments if there's enough interest in this dataset. You can scrape word ids from here: http://www.urbandictionary.com/yesterday.php?date=2017-03-29&amp;page=2 (note that each date has many pages) and then just throw them into the urbandictionary api link above. Best bet would be to start one month prior (April), and just ignore if it's already in the DB, because I'm not exactly sure what date in May I finished.

It compressed to around 400mb. If someone could upload mirrors or make a torrent out of it and post it in the comments that'd be great because I won't be able to personally host it for more than a couple of months. Also, it's a `7z` file, which will be a bit weird for some, but there are freeware/open-source extractors for it on every major platform - just head over to google. Here's the file:

"Hi! We've just added another new dataset to Gourdian, this time courtesy of OpenAQ.org - in their own words ""OpenAQ is a non-profit organization empowering communities around the globe to clean their air by harmonizing, sharing, and using open air quality data.""

This dataset itself is a relatively small sample of their data, and it has some overlap with one of our other datasets that we get from EPA AQS (https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs), but it has the large advantage of being global rather than US-only.

The data is relatively old, so we wouldn't recommend building something on it that relies ongoing updates, but it could be useful for historical analysis.

"Hi,

I'm trying to train a model which replaces grammatically correct but uncommon sentences, with their more common counterparts. So I'm looking for any datasets of grammatically uncommon sentences paired with their more common versions. 

For eg.

1. Already, enough punishment had been given.

2. Enough punishment had been given already.

3. Enough punishment had already been given.

All sentences say the same thing, but No. 3 is the most likely version you would encounter.

&amp;#x200B;

Another eg.

1. Either by you or someone else, the bill must be paid.

2. Either you or someone else must pay the bill.

3. The bill must be paid either by you or someone else.

No. 1 would be the unlikely version. No. 2 &amp; 3 are more likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions where I can find these? Or any other mechanisms through which I can achieve the end goal of replacing uncommon grammar with ""common grammar"".

For instance, given the line ""In general, the first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights"" (from the [Constitution of the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States) Wikipedia page), and the Wikipedia page for [History of the US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Ratification_of_the_Constitution), the line in the History of the US Constitution page, ""These first ten Amendments became known as the Bill of Rights."" would be the label because these two sentences are ideologically similar.

I live in Connecticut. I am trying to build up a case for stricter regulations and even a lowering of our electricity bill. currently all residents pay a minimum of 20$ to be on the grid + 7.03 cents KWH for delivery fees alone.... this is not including the generation rates (that is different but similar issue) I am trying to get our local regulation department PURA to justify way eversource can charge 7 cents a kwh for aged infrastructure and terrible emergency response performance. i do believe it is one of the higest in the country but there is literally no reason for this. especially when they just laid off a bunch of people to cut costs

From those of you with utility bills. I am asking you to post your state, connection fee, and delivery rates, you can also include your generation rate if you would like.

So, I built a [patient data generator](https://github.com/johnschrom/patient-data-generator) that's based off NAMCS, and then made a set of [300k patient records](https://github.com/johnschrom/ambulatory-ehr-data) using that generator.  This uses sampling weights provided by the CDC to make the data representative at the state-level for most states, and adds some slight randomness to continuous variables (so you're not getting the same patients over and over again).

So ideally I need data that shows, for each country, its connections with other countries.

"The TSA has is publishing more and more data via it's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Reading Room.

I've created a project on github [https://github.com/mikelor/tsathroughput](https://github.com/mikelor/tsathroughput) that contains the source for extracting the information from the .PDF files and converts them to JSON and CSV files. 

The [/data](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/tree/main/data) folder contains the source .PDFs going back to 2018 while the /data/raw/tsa/throughput folder contains .json files.

If you just want to work with the data, I would recommend looking at the [/data/processed/tsa/throughput](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/tree/main/data/processed/tsa/throughput) folder. This folder contains .CSV files for individual airports as wall as a .CSV file for All airports (unintuitively named ""TsaThroughput.None.csv""). 

I've broken out the airports that I'm interested in. If you'd like to learn more. Feel free to leave a comment in the ""[Discussions](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/discussions)"" section or open an ""[Issue](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/issues)"".

While doing some research on Tsa Throughput today, I ran across this prior post that uses an alternate method of converting the PDF files to .CSV

[(1) TSA Throughput Data for US airports per hour at the checkpoint level : datasets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/hfpyku/tsa_throughput_data_for_us_airports_per_hour_at/) 

It looks like the author ran into a problem with data extraction sometime back in July of last year. My method continues to work, and I attempt to update the data on a weekly basis (as long as TSA publishes the information). Ultimately I hope to automate the update process (source also included for that)

Please note, I started this project to learn python and machine learning concepts. I like to apply my learning to what interests me. In this case I work for an airline. My goal is to predict TSA Throughput, but boy Covid really did a number on the data. Feel free to contribute, or just use the data.

Interesting python code to look at would be

* [/src/tsa\_throughput/src/data/make\_airport\_dataset.py](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/blob/main/src/tsa_throughput/src/data/make_airport_dataset.py) \- Creates the CSV file for specific airport
* [/src/tsa\_throughput/src/notebooks/animate.py](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/blob/main/src/tsa_throughput/notebooks/animate.py)\- Creates an animation based on data (see attached graphic)

In 2020, it’s estimated that the digital sphere consists of 44 zettabytes of data, so there’s certainly no shortage of free and interesting data.

There are plenty of repositories curating data sets to suit all your needs, and many of these sites also filter out the not-so-great ones, meaning you don’t have to waste time downloading useless CSV files. 

If you want to learn how to analyze data, improve your data literacy skills, or learn how to create data visualizations, readily available data sets are a great palace to start.

In this blog post, we’ll take a look at some of our favorite places to find free data sets, so you can spend less time searching and more time uncovering insights.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Fivethirtyeight***

***Link -*** [***https://data.fivethirtyeight.com***](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com)

FiveThirtyEight is an independent collection of data on US politics, US sport and other general interest datasets. It specializes in the collation and ranking of reliable political and opinion polls. We’ve used them in a number of projects, finding out some interesting things along the way, like when Donald Trump is most active on Twitter ([Sign up to VAYU](https://vayu.gyana.co.uk/signup) for free to view the template).

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Google Trends***

***Link -*** [***https://trends.google.com/trends/***](https://trends.google.com/trends/)

Google provides readily accessible data sets on search trends, and you can customize the parameters to easily find whatever it is you’re interested in. We recommend exporting the dataset and running it through [VAYU](https://www.gyana.co.uk/) for one-click visualizations and advanced analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***ProPublica Data Store***

***Link -*** [***https://www.propublica.org/datastore/***](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/)

ProPublica, probably best known for their award-winning investigative journalism, collects data pertaining to the US economy, finance, health, industry, politics and more. They have both free and premium datasets, should you need to delve deeper into whatever it is you’re exploring.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Centers for Disease and Control Prevention***

***Link -*** [***https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html***](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html)

The CDC collects the abundance of health data provided by US government research and sources, including data and research on alcohol, life expectancy, obesity and chronic diseases. This is a great resource for analyzing and understanding public health.

&amp;#x200B;

***Please feel free to check*** [***this link***](https://www.gyana.co.uk/post/6-great-websites-with-free-data-sets/) ***for the rest of them, we also do recommend running them through Vayu to find and share interesting insights.***",not_spam

"Hello, i'm a computer science major in a data visualization class and I am struggling to get a data set for my final project. My interest is in running and the new Nike  Vaporfly shoes. I found an application called Strava and it has soooo much data including self reported shoe data, but I can't figure out how to get other people's data. I know that it is possible because there was a article in the New York Times where they had that information. I know its a long shot, but maybe somebody has an idea of how to accomplish this.

"Hi,

So I have been collecting data for a few months using excel. I collect data every day on a few select stocks that appear on a scanner I use. I have been manually inputting some of the information and letting excel formulas calculate lots of the data I need but I am running into a problem collecting chart data.

As of now the data I manually input are dates, stock name, price, volume and change %. I want to capture an image of what the chart for that stock on that day looked like. I have been manually taking screenshots of charts and saving them individually to a folder. Is there a better way to collect the data of the chart? Is there any methods of automating the screenshotting of a program and saving it?

------------------------

# Important info

**New field for submission objects:**

There is a new field available called ""subreddit_type.""  This field usually has a value of ""public"" but can also have a value of ""user"" if someone makes a post in their profile page.  The Washington Post makes extensive use of this new feature.

**Upcoming changes in 2018:**

There have been a lot of requests for smaller file sizes since the monthly dumps (especially for comments) is rather large.  Beginning in 2018, I will be providing daily comment and submission dumps.  I will still provide the monthly dumps in the same format that I have in the past, but the daily dumps will give people the ability to test their programs on much smaller data files.  

The daily dumps will have a 3 day lag in order to allow scores to settle while also allowing users to remove or delete comments and posts that may have accidentally included private information or other data that was not intended to be archived long-term.  The daily dumps will include submissions and comments within one archived file and will have the format RCS_YYYY-MM-DD.bz2. For example, on January 5'th, 2018, the daily comment and submissions made on January 1'st will be available as RCS_2018-01-01.bz2

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know!

Also, as always, if you would like to donate to this project, please use the following link:  https://pushshift.io/donations/  -- donations are always appreciated but never required.

However, I keep on getting the same values in each column and the next value is printed to the next row. How would I be able to rearrange the feature matrix? I tried to form a code which can be found below, but, I don't know what my mistake in the code. I formed different codes but the results were still the same. Please find below the codes formed:

&amp;#x200B;

Code 1:

    # Matrix array:
    DataSizerow=0
    DataSizecolumn=0
    Data = np.zeros((1425,15))
    
    # Forming a feature matrix from frequency, PSD and AutoCorrelation values:

            DataFrame_Feature = np.array(X_axis_values_psd_mean)
            DataFrame_Feature1 = np.array(x_axis_list_filtered)
            DataSizecolumn = DataSizecolumn + 1
            print('Data Size column: ',DataSizecolumn)
            Data[DataSizecolumn - 1] = DataFrame_Feature
            if DataSizecolumn in range(1, dataset.shape[1]):
                DataSizerow = DataSizerow + 1
                print('Data Size row: ', DataSizerow)
                Data[DataSizerow - 1] = DataFrame_Feature
            print('Sensor {0}'.format(k))
            print('Data Frame: ', Data)

            DataFrame1 = np.zeros((1426, 16))
            for DataSizecolumn1 in range(1, dataset.shape[1]):
                print('Data Size column: ', DataSizecolumn1)
                for DataSizerow1 in range(1, dataset.shape[0]):
                    print('Data Size row: ', DataSizerow1)
                    DataFrame1[DataSizerow1][DataSizecolumn1] = DataFrame_Feature
            print('Sensor {0}'.format(k))
            print('DataFrame: ', DataFrame1)

&amp;#x200B;

Code 3:

            DataSizerow2 = 0
            DataFrame2 = np.zeros((1426, 16))
            for DataSizecolumn2 in range(1, dataset.shape[1]):
                print('Data Size column: ', DataSizecolumn2)

            print('Sensor {0}'.format(k))
            print('DataFrame: ', DataFrame2)

&amp;#x200B;

The expected result should be like the matrix below of single row:

              Sensor 1 | Sensor 2 | Sensor 3 | Sensor 4 | Sensor 5 | Sensor 6 | 
    Data file     13   |   51.5   |    13    |   13     |    13    |    13    |

    Data file     8.5  |    14    |    20    |   18.6    |   9.5     |   39    |
              Sensor 13 | Sensor 14 | Sensor 15 | 
    Data file     8.5   |    8.5    |    8.5    | 

&amp;#x200B;

But the actual result is below:

              Sensor 1 | Sensor 2 | Sensor 3 | Sensor 4 | Sensor 5 | Sensor 6 | 
    Data file     13   |   13     |    13    |   13     |    13    |    13    |
              Sensor 7 | Sensor 8 | Sensor 9 | Sensor 10 | Sensor 11 | Sensor 12 | 
    Data file     13   |    13    |    13    |    13     |    13     |    13     |
              Sensor 13 | Sensor 14 | Sensor 15 | 
    Data file     13    |    13     |    13     |

"I have a question in mind that I would like to answer, but I would need to have income distribution data at the county level. I found some relevant data on the U.S. Census website, but only lumped statistics  like *median* income for the whole county. What I need is the actual list of individual incomes so that I can make a histogram for that county.

Is it possible to get that kind of data from the Census site somewhere, or is that resolution of data kept completely private? I'm obviously not looking for any personally identifying information, just enough data points to plot the distribution and calculate the statistics I'm actually interested in instead of being handed a median or average or whatever. Multiple years going back through history would be ideal, but one recent year would suffice to get started.

I'm sure it must be somewhere on the Census site if it's available, but I'm not having any luck finding it and if someone knows that it's simply not public I could avoid wasting tons of time continuing to look for it.

"Hi, my group and I have to do a multiple linear regression or ANOVA project. We originally wanted to do something along the lines of how does age, race, sex, and level of automation in an industry affect your employment rate. However, the only data we found showed rows of industries and the numbers or percents of each race, sex, age etc in that said industry. This data wouldn't work right? For MLR, we need data of i.e. 10000 individuals, and their specifics regarding race sex age so that we can see how this works with a specific response variable right? We can't just have a chart of the total individuals employed by their specifics.

"New to data here, so I'm quite confused sometimes using APIs and please excuse me if I am not using the best technical terms.   


So I am running into the problem of trying to find data for Census tracts and/or cities.  Perhaps I don't know where to download the data or if there is a filter from 3rd party websites that can draw that data, but I just can't find it.   
I am trying to strictly find data for age and gender for cities, tracts, or counties.  Most of these third party sites go too far and provide processed data, pie charts, or summarized charts.    


For example, I go here: [https://factfinder.census.gov](https://factfinder.census.gov/) , its great!  But I am trying to get the data that led to what they got.  Basically I am trying to replicate what this website does but I don't know where to get the Data in CSV form.

"Hello!

I am a MSc Clinical Psychology student, and for my thesis I am conducting qualitative research aiming to better understand digital accumulation and data hoarding, and the impact it has on an individual. I am looking for individuals who have experienced the urge to collect or hoard data (i.e files, photos, ebooks, emails etc) to the point it affects their life in some way. The experience of digital/data hoarding is completely subjective and it can manifest in many different ways, from Pinterest and social media to collections stored in hard drives and cloud storage. I would like to ask anyone who has some insight into this through lived experience or otherwise to comment on this thread with whatever they would like to share, or if preferable to message me directly with their comments on this topic.

" The problem: Currently I am building a pricing alignment tool. Essentially, I have 2 categories I am trying to compare, Price of Special Order Products vs. Price Stock Order Products. My team wants to have visibility into which Special Order Products are priced higher than stock products. The issue I am having is at times, there are multiple prices for special order and stock products depending on the store due to regional pricing.

At the moment I have created a dot strip plot that looks like [this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/ToHV5v5) The circles represent special prices (there are multiple circles per row because there may be multiple special order prices, same goes for the bars), the bars represent stock prices and the color dimension for the bars is a visual cue for whether it is priced below, higher, or equal. Blue means stock is higher priced, red means stock is priced lower. (please ignore the bar graph, they are different info)

Objective: Again the objective is to gain visibility into which special order products are priced higher than stock. We want special order to be lower cause typically these products are sold to professionals and in bulk.

Imgur: The image is posted without much detail because I do not want my company thinking I am sharing sensitive information. Also, the dashboard has a lot more detail but at the moment I am concerned with this visual on the dashboard.

"Hello,

I am studying program synthesis from natural language, and I am currently working on a system that will attempt to generate actual Python code given the natural language input, for instance:

* sort 'myList' in descending order
* `sorted(myList, reverse=True)`

Current python datasets ([Django](https://github.com/odashi/ase15-django-dataset) and [CoNaLa](https://conala-corpus.github.io/)) have 2 major drawbacks: Django is very focused, the generalization capability will be very low, and CoNaLa (the manually curated version) contains very few examples for a model to actually learn something (2,379 training and 500 test).

Therefore, apart from augmentation techniques (e.g. from libraries / python documentation), I thought about an initial phase, that is, training on an *introductory / tutorial* kind of dataset, with focused examples similar to what a human would follow when learning programming, such as:

* call the function max with the arguments 1 and 2 =&gt; `max(1, 2)`
* generate a list of integers from 10 to 20 =&gt; `list(range(10, 21))`
* call the function 'getArea' with arguments 'width' and 'height' and assign the result to 'a' =&gt; `a = getArea(width, height)`

I've looked at different Python tutorials, but couldn't found something that can be easily 'scrapped', and therefore be assembled into a dataset. So, my question is, do you know any resources that may contain this kind of example pairs of **focused** programming tasks?

"Hi all,

I've been doing a lot of survey analysis lately, both from Coursera MOOCs, and from in-class paper-based surveys. I'm very interested in using open workflows, and although we often are not able to publish the data widely because of institutional policy and ethics agreements, we are a number of different research groups internally using the data, and I try to practice good scientific practice. I spend a surprising amount of time cleaning up the data - checking for accuracy of data entry, converting NAs, renaming and ordering categorical variables etc, and I try to do all of this in an R+Knitr document, which I can re-run at any point if I get new data, and also just to document explicitly what I've been doing. 

However, I've been thinking about data formats to store/share this data. CSV seems to be the standard format of the open data movement, and it's very interoperable, however you loose a lot of metadata. For example the ordering of categorical variables (Levels: Strongly Disagree &lt; Disagree &lt; Neutral &lt; Agree &lt; Strongly Agree), whether a variable is categorical or numerical, the full question names (ie. db$course.fun.Why.enroll - the full question name ""I enrolled in this course because I thought it would be fun""), etc. 

I've thought about this in two ways. First is internal to my R workflow - I like to separate between data cleanup and organization, and the actual report writing (in R+Markdown). I recently submitted a pull request to a likert package that would let me store some of this metadata (specifically groups of questions, and full question names) as metadata, so that I would be able to render a likert-graph over a certain number of questions without having to always rename the variables (https://github.com/jbryer/likert/pull/7)... This would store the metadata as attributes to the data.frame, which would be saved as an Rdata object etc... 

However, this is a bit of a kludge, and it certainly doesn't answer the question of how to store the data and share it with people who don't use R... Ideally we'd have a universal file format where we were able to include the whole ""code book"" - metadata about what kinds of columns, groupings, full question names, maybe even details about how a certain data field was calculated, the meaning of various codes etc... 

I realize this might be very obscure to people not interested in open data, R, etc, but there might be other people on the list who find this interesting - and you might even know about efforts or people working in this direction?

As the title suggests, what are some sources of large scale data collection that can be utilised for the purpose of gaining insights to help drive decisions related to e-commerce?

I am putting together a university project which broadly aims to do the above for commercial gain, using machine learning algorithms, something I am very new to but which is a requirement of the project.

Recently looked into collecting data from Amazon to 'train' the software to provide insights that could be use to optimise listings etc, but have realised that the data collected using the Amazon Product Data API is restricted, and to scrape (another new topic for me) is naughty and against ToS, not a good start when suggesting a project to the project coordinator, therefore I am wondering what other similar sources are there online which is either not restricted, or much easier to gain access to on a large scale?

Any general advice is also very much appreciated as I am learning as much as I can in this early stage.",not_spam

* retail sales volumes,
* prices,
* product characteristics (e.g., separate columns for flavour, sugar content, package size, etc.)

"&gt;**TL;DR:** See example notebooks below 👇

I am happy to announce that I finally finished cleaning, organizing, creating baselines, and developing an automated collection pipeline that collects minute-by-minute market data for Cryptocurrencies. It updates on Kaggle every day! And will keep doing so until the competition is over! \[Maybe even more\]

The whole project took me a lot of time to develop and is not easy to maintain, so please if you find this of value: Your feedback &amp; support is highly appreciated!

## The Competition

As some of you know, there is Crypto forecasting competition is running on Kaggle: ""G-Research Crypto Forecasting"". In this competition, we need to use machine learning for forecasting short-term returns of popular cryptocurrencies \[such as bitcoin, ether, dogecoin..\] We are provided a dataset of millions of rows of high-frequency market data dating back to 2018 which we should use to build our models on. Once the submission deadline has passed, the final score will be calculated over the following 3 months using live crypto data as it is collected.

## Auto-updating Kaggle dataset

To make things more interesting: I created an Auto-Updating Kaggle dataset that collects high-frequency market data for multiple cryptocurrencies.

* Updates daily on Kaggle!
* Available for anyone to play with!

Also, I also released **20+ starter notebooks** each demonstrating a different model or method for forecasting future returns.

This project was meant to be for the currently running Crypto Forecasting Competition by G-Research. However, since it is publicly available I assumed many others would like to also have a look :)

**Mimics ""Real-Life"" better than typical datasets**

This is a unique opportunity to work in a much more ""real-life"" setup than usual Kaggle. Because the datasets update daily.

* so.. If you mess up and overfit..
* You see it tomorrow! 😂

Anyway, this is an ongoing project that is also beginner-friendly since it is highly documented. Many more Time Series / Finance-related notebooks will be released in the future so this can also serve as a ""first stop"" when studying Time Series analysis.

## Auto updating - Full Price Datasets

I created an up-to-today \[auto updating\] dataset which contains the full historical data for all assets of the competition so you can easily build models that utilize it. The datasets are split to each asset since they are much heavier than the competition data. The datasets have also been labeled as described in the competition overview and had been organized in a way that they are at the exact format of the competition data.

**The goal of this is to provide a dataset that:**

1. Contains the FULL history for each asset. Currently, the competition data goes back to 2018. This dataset contains data from even earlier.
2. Auto updating daily - Due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, we should train our models on the most recent data available. These datasets have a backend pipeline for collecting, formatting, and reuploading to kaggle. They are scheduled to be updated daily, every single day until the end of the competition.
3. Preprocessed - The datasets had been ffilled to overcome any missing values issue that is present in the original competition dataset.

**The Datasets:**

* [Binance Coin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-binance-coin)
* [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-bitcoin-cash)
* [Bitcoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-bitcoin)
* [Cardano](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-cardano)
* [Dogecoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-dogecoin)
* [Eos.io](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-eos-io)
* [Ethereum](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-ethereum)
* [Ethereum Classic](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-ethereum-classic)
* [Iota](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-iota)
* [Litecoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-litecoin)
* [Monero](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-monero)
* [Maker](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-maker)
* [Stellar](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-stellar)
* [TRON](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-tron)

&gt;**Bonus dataset:** I've also uploaded a dataset containing the most powerful source for predicting cryptocurrencies movement: Elon Musk's Twitter 😂! It is simply an updated dataset of all Elon Musk's tweets 😂. I must check if Elon Musk can help us win! 👌 You can play with it yourself [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/elon-musks-twitter-updated-031121).



**Technical details about the Data** For every asset in the competition, the following fields from [Binance's official API endpoint for historical candlestick data](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#klinecandlestick-data) are collected, saved, and processed.

1. timestamp - A timestamp for the minute covered by the row.
2. Asset\_ID - An ID code for the cryptoasset.
3. Count - The number of trades that took place this minute.
4. Open - The USD price at the beginning of the minute.
5. High - The highest USD price during the minute.
6. Low - The lowest USD price during the minute.
7. Close - The USD price at the end of the minute.
8. Volume - The number of cryptoasset u units traded during the minute.
9. VWAP - The volume-weighted average price for the minute. 10.Target - 15 minute residualized returns. See the 'Prediction and Evaluation section of this notebook for details of how the target is calculated.
10. Weight - Weight, defined by the competition hosts [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cstein06/tutorial-to-the-g-research-crypto-competition)
11. Asset\_Name - Human readable Asset name.

**Indexing** The dataframe is indexed by `timestamp` and sorted from oldest to newest. The first row starts at the first timestamp available on the exchange, which is July 2017 for the longest-running pairs.

I was hoping on feeding on the tweeter stream but realized it doesn't give the age of a twitter user :/

Any advise is welcome, thank you!

EDIT: I can't even find some nice forum that displays the age of the poster... Anyone know some?",not_spam

"Hey r/datasets, I'm a PhD student in Math/stats and I'm doing some cluster computing NLP work for the next couple months. Specifically,I'm doing unsupervised text segmentation on (we'll say) news articles and I'd like to find some text that has already been segmented so I have a ""ground-truth"" to judge my model by.

Just in case someone who reads this and has the dataset I'm looking for doesn't know what I mean, I'd like to have a dataset of documents where the documents have been cut into logical pieces based on their topics. Think about the front page of a newspaper, even if you concatenated all of the articles together a person could read through the long document and pull out where one article ended and another began just by the topics being discussed. I'd like a dataset that has the newspaper along with markers saying where one article ends and another beings. 

One of the nice things about algorithms is that they don't actually ""know"" the difference between domains so a genome annotated by genes or strings of random words grouped by topics works as well as real text. Although, to be fair,a big part of these models is context dependent so a dataset related to pop culture/entertainment would be awesome!

I know I'm asking for a lot so in the interest of fairness, I'd be happy to give something in return. I've been published doing data analysis in astrophysics, epidemiology and genetics and I'm publishing a paper about SVM theory later this year so if any of those things are relevant to you (or if there's something else I could help with) lets make our own version of the reddit exchange!",not_spam

I've read through past posts and lots of folks have posted data sets by subject, but I don't know where to search for something with a multi-item scale in particular.

The criteria are:

* Permission/approval to use the data (a must) 
* Minimum sample size of ≈ 200 
* Two multiple item scales with at least five measures for each scale 
* Two variables that could be treated as DVs 
* Three variables that could be treated as IVs 
* The ability to narrow the data set down to somewhere between 10 and 15 variables

"About a year ago when I was a student journalist, I created a crime map using daily crime log data released by my campus police department on the school's website. Not all campus police departments release this information this way -- nor do they have to legally -- but I found that many do so anyway.

I'd like to create a public database/website that displays the status of this data per college/university, if it's accessible, and how. I started building a Google docs spreadsheet that I would eventually convert to be a database, but I'm quickly realizing that it is going to take a long long time:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fyyaZ_ohZDW5jCsnQDJ-4NtiMCIqBakLmgOjvGjfp4s/edit?usp=sharing

My end goal is to collect daily crime incidents from accessible logs and put it into a giant geocoded database. I can do most of the heavy lifting regarding coding, but I'd like to talk to anyone who is willing to help. I am not doing this for political purposes or for money, and I would absolutely share credit in any end result. Just PM me with your details and I can add you to the spreadsheet.

"I’m doing a project and I’m looking for the race and ethnic breakdowns of a city by age group. 

When I use the American FactFinder guided search I can find data sets for each individual race or ethnic grouping by age, but not one set with all that data. 

So instead of having a single data set that shows the age breakdown of  Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders for a certain city, I’m looking for an age breakdown of a specific city for Whites, Hispanic, Native Americans, and so on. 

So Under 5 would be the first age group and it would show 

White: 10,500

Black: 8,000

Etc. 

And then it would be the same thing with every race grouping for 5-9 and then 10-14, and so on. 

Is there a way to view this data that way? I don’t understand why it’s separated by race for entire datasets. I just want one dataset with all age groups broken down by all race groups. ",not_spam

"Hello. I am working on undergrad research in econometrics and am seeking some advice/help in terms of finding data sets and picking variables. I have an idea chosen for my topic, but I need to make a official proposal including a rough linear regression equation to turn in to my teacher soon.

My topic idea is to observe the causes for recent decline in female labor force participation in the US. I am hoping this topic is not too broad. Initially, I was going to look at whether campaign spending impacted voter share in Senate races from 2012 data sets, but I find this idea a tad boring and would like to make my new idea work if possible.

My ideas for variables include the obvious: age &amp; teen participation rates (16-24), race/ethnicity, educational attainment, children, martial status, avg weekly hours worked, etc. However, I wanted to also see if the increase in opioid addiction in the US could also be having an impact on labor force participation specifically for women, as well as paid family leave benefits in the US vs other countries and labor force participation of immigrant women.

So with all said, does anyone have any suggestions for me both as to whether this topic is viable as a project in my course, given my limited time, as well as where I could find the data for such a topic? I have been reading a lot of literature on the topic, but having a hard time finding actual data sets that I could use for my regressions.

Thanks!",not_spam
"I am currently between jobs and work on an idea to improve the long-term dependency of RNNs, when you (pre-)train them by predicting the sequences.

I have encouraging results on a dataset I created myself: 500 hundred books from the Gütenberg project (https://www.gutenberg.org/) to train and 100 to test.

But, if I want to publish, it would be better if at least one of the experiments were on a more or less standard dataset. At least a dataset with some research paper trying to predict the sequence (so that I can use them as a baseline).

* The dataset needs to be &gt;10M characters (well, I could do with less but it would be less interesting).
* The 1B words dataset won't do because the sentences are independent. My improvement is on long sequences (capturing the context).
* I don't know if PennTreeBank satisfies the two criteria above, but I don't have the money to buy it (I am an independent researcher for the moment).

Would you have some idea?

I don't want to get into the details of my idea before I post an article on arXiv (hopefully in the next few weeks).",not_spam

I have now converted my code so it uses the Johns Hopkins timeseries data instead of their daily files.  In addition, I am also now using the Hopkins timeseries data to produce csv files with counts of **deaths \*per day\*** for all USA counties.  These csv files include the county FIPS code so this data can easily be merged with other datasets that also have the county FIPS code.

To keep all this straight, the addresses for the csv files has been tweaked as follows.  **Replace ‘03’ with the 2 digit code for other months.**  Each night my code updates the csv files for the current month.

COVID cases per day:

[https://mappingsupport.com/p2/disaster/coronavirus/JHU\_count\_per\_day/cases\_2020\_03.csv](https://mappingsupport.com/p2/disaster/coronavirus/JHU_count_per_day/cases_2020_03.csv)

There is an **errata** file on the Hopkins GitHub site where they make a note whenever they change the timeseries data.  I plan to monitor that errata file so I can keep my csv files in sync.  That errata file is at:

[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse\_covid\_19\_data/csse\_covid\_19\_time\_series/Errata.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/Errata.csv)

"First, I would like to extend a very heartfelt thank you to /u/PineappleFund for their generous contribution to Pushshift.io.  Their contribution has enabled us to increase our services to the academic community and has cemented the long-term viability of the project.  

**Let's talk about Project Discovery!**

With that said, I want to talk about a new project that will help take research to the next level and to get the community's opinions, suggestions and support for this new project.  While the contribution made by Pineapple was extremely generous, in order to turn this project into a reality, we will need a bit more resources to see it through.

**What is this all about?**

A lot of academic institutions and data scientists use my monthly Reddit dumps to do amazing research.  If you [check out Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C21&amp;q=Pushshift.io&amp;btnG=), you will see that two dozen papers have been published using this valuable data source.  

There have been some interesting research on the data using machine learning.  Unfortunately, the data size is huge and not everyone can afford the resources needed to do amazing research on this data.  This is something I'd like to change with your help.

The new project is tentatively called **Project Discovery** and it involves bringing together the best data scientists, data visualization experts and machine learning / NLP researchers on Reddit and within the academic community at large.  

My goal is to create a time-share server that allows many researchers and data scientists to analyze massive amounts of data using huge computer resources.  The amount of funding needed to see this through will be in the range of $30-$40 thousand dollars, but Pineapplefund's contribution is enough to get the framework together and create an expandable server that can grow over time.  

As many of you know, Nvidia recently released their [Titan V](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/titan/titan-v/) GPU with Tensorflow processors.  This card is capable of up to 110 teraflops of processing power.  I want to include this in Project Discovery so that experts in machine learning can use this power to help analyze big data. 

I am putting together an extremely powerful development server that will be shared with researchers.  It will include the entire Reddit data corpus and also constantly update with new Reddit data from my ingest.  

**The end goal specs for this server include:**

- [Dual Epyc CPU Motherboard](https://www.supermicro.com/Aplus/motherboard/EPYC7000/H11DSU-iN.cfm) that supports two AMD Epyc CPU's.

- (2) [AMD EPYC 7601](http://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7601) with 32 cores (64 Threads total).  This would give a total of 128 threads for the system

- Samsung Memory (32 or 64GB ECC DIMMS).  It would be awesome to go with the 64GB DIMMS to support a total system memory of 2TB but my goal is to get at least a minimum of 1TB of memory which we can do with 32GB x 32 memory slots.

- 6 TB of NVMe storage utilizing [Samsung's 2TB NVMe drives](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-960-PRO-Internal-MZ-V6P2T0BW/dp/B01LY3Y9PH)

- 12 TB of SSD storage utilizing 3 of [Samsung's 4TB SSD](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-75E4T0B-AM/dp/B01G844OOO) drives.

- 48 TB of [Platter storage](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-BarraCuda-3-5-Inch-Internal-ST12000DM0007/dp/B075XNL17G) for backup purposes.

- (1) Nvidia Titan V GPU for tensorflow / machine learning projects.  

I want to get feedback from the community for all of this.  Especially the OS that will be used for the main server.  I will have (2) smaller development servers with ~ 128 GB of memory to test code before running the code on the larger server.  Each of the smaller development servers will have the complete Reddit corpus as well.  

**Operating System and Sysadmin support needed**

The OS I am leaning towards is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (at least until Ubuntu 18.04 LTS becomes available).  All of the servers will have a 300Mbps fiber connection to the internet.  

I will also need assistance from sysadmins with experience setting up multi-user environments and to make sure that we have proper security in place for Project Discovery.  

As this project progresses into 2018, I will have a sign-up form for academic students and researchers so that they can get set up with an account and get access to all the various servers.  We will have to come up with a plan for time-share when using the Titan V (once we are able to get that).  

I may do a kickstarter (a 50K kickstarter would be enough to see this come alive in 2018) to get the rest of the needed funding.  I will work with some of the other /r/datasets mods who have experience with machine learning and figure out the needed funds to make this amazing project come to life.  Memory costs will be around $10k for 32 of the 32GB DIMMs.  The two Epyc server CPU's will be ~ $10k for both of them.  The storage aspects will be around $5-$10k total.  And the Titan V card is around $3k.  It will probably be beneficial to reach out to AMD to see if they would like to contribute to this project (along with Nvidia and Samsung).  

The server can also be scaled up (use one CPU to begin and then scale up to 2).  

If this can happen, it would be a huge huge huge benefit to the academic community at large.  I know a lot of extremely smart data scientists who could do amazing things with these resources, so I will do my best to make this a reality for 2018.

Again, if you have any thoughts or ideas, please let me know!  

**Pre-installed Software**

I know that software developers and researchers have different preferences on what type of database systems they would like to use.  To that end, I would like to support as many open-source products as possible so that everyone has the tools they need for their project.  Here is a short list of open-source products that will be available:

- PostgreSQL 
- MySQL / MariaDB
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
- Hadoop
- Apache Derby
- Redis
- Elasticsearch (6.x)
- Apache Lucene
- Python3 with R, Numpy, etc.  If you need a module, we'll install it.
- Python 2
- Perl 
- Node.js
- Java


Here is a recap of the end goal for the system:

Min System Memory|1,024 GB

"**[nfl_dataset_2002-2019week6.csv \(Google Drive link\)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/143NanTexjsO42kXlG8GjDbkSJ-sSKHC9/view)**

I scraped all the NFL game stats on ESPN from 2002 through present (2019 Week 6). Not the Box Score but the Team Stats page.

I grabbed all regular season and playoff games but excluded preseason and Pro Bowl. There are 4628 games in the dataset. Three games didn't have working pages on ESPN. Those are:

* [DAL @ WASH 12-30-2007](https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=271230028)
* [CAR @ PIT 12-23-2010](https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=301223023)
* [TB @ ATL 01-01-2012](https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=320101001)

Each stat has a column for the away team and the home team:

* date
* teams
* first downs
* third down conversions-attempts
* fourth down conversions-attempts
* passing yards
* rushing yards
* total yards
* pass completions-attempts
* sacks number-yards
* rushing attempts
* fumbles
* interceptions
* total turnovers
* penalties number-yards
* redzone conversions-trips
* total drives
* defense and special teams TDs
* time of possession
* score

Those aren't the exact column labels but you get the idea.

One thing I noticed is that red zone conversions aren't recorded until 2006. I haven't noticed any other quirks but I also haven't looked very closely yet. There is also nothing to indicate neutral-site games so keep that in mind.

I'll probably organize the data better and post it on Kaggle when the season is over. But I don't want to post mid-season and I thought somebody might find it useful in the meantime. Let me know if you find any errors.",not_spam

"Hello /r/datasets!

## What?

On Friday, [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) filed their [2019 Year End Report](https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00401224/?tab=filings), and it's an absolute beast - the largest filing ever generated by the [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/)! It contains 24,656,453 contributions by individuals totaling **$525,124,217.30**. 

We publicly open sourced [our analysis](https://github.com/CircaVictor/actblue-analysis-1378435) of the filing along with [state data sources](https://github.com/CircaVictor/actblue-analysis-1378435/tree/master/data/states). This type of data is never seen in a timely manner (or at all) and is a HUGE undertaking to export and analyze, examples:

* [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/) [[data]](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/actblue-analysis)
* [https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katherinemiller/elizabeth-warren-actblue-data-bernie-sanders-kamala-harris](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katherinemiller/elizabeth-warren-actblue-data-bernie-sanders-kamala-harris) [[data]](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2019-08-actblue-donations)

If you curious about some fresh high level data, here are some numbers that we pulled across the entire cycle for the [Iowa Caucus ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/18AMOMG01cyGgwTWTH0R_ZreRnNMTbCL2). Surprisingly a lot of individuals from [tech companies](https://i.imgur.com/nvGEsUy.png) (from Bernie's ""Overall by Employer"" tab) are now contributing.

## Additional Analysis

  * [Principal Committees by total](https://github.com/CircaVictor/actblue-analysis-1378435/blob/master/analysis/principal-committees-overall.csv)
  * [Individual contributors by total](https://github.com/CircaVictor/actblue-analysis-1378435/blob/master/analysis/individual-contributors-overall.csv)

## Who?

My name is Justin and I'm the cto cofounder of a nonpartisan company named [Circa Victor](https://circavictor.com/). Since 2015 we have taken a tech approach to political problems starting with Federal Campaign Finance.

To accomplish this goal, we created a clone of the [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/) and have tracked EVERY data point that has been generated since January 1st, 2010.

## Why?

We feel that it's every citizen's right to be informed. We are not trying to push any political agenda. Our desire is data comprehension and accuracy. 

We __*strongly*__ believe that accurate, up-to-minute data will lead to better, responsible, and actionable reporting which in turn will help nurture an informed populace.

*Anecdotally*: I have a friend who worked at a payment processor (rhymes with pipe) and internally they felt Trump had a bigger chance of winning than the media lead on due to the sheer number of payments they were processing for him vs Hillary.

I'm NOT saying that Campaign Finance is the missing piece to figuring out who is going to win an election. However, campaign finance data is a LOT more concrete than polling data as polling data is relative. It's the missing vertical that most people are knowingly overlooking because they are not looking at it in an accurately and timely manner.

Unfortunately we feel that we are the only group actively working toward this. We have reached out to Committees, Non-Profits, Researchers, Campaign Finance leaders all with little to no traction. 

We are a small team of 4 guys (I'm the only software engineer; self-taught, didn't go to college) and we humbly admit that this problem is too big for us to solve alone. We need help and want to raise awareness. The best way we know how to do that is to press data into the public's hands.

---

To be more transparent, this data work does not make enough money to pay the bills. None of us have taken a paycheck since the Winter of 2017, but we have continued to work on this because we feel this is imporant.

To pay the bills, I work from Seattle as a remote software engineer for [PBS Kids](https://twitter.com/twaffl3s/status/1207163692787257344) - a job which I love and am very proud of.

Happy to answer any questions as time permits. Feel free to dm me if you want a response or if you're looking for more in depth data and analysis. Thank you.

---

**tldr;** we built a clone of the Federal Election Commission. As a public service we are open sourcing our analysis w/ data of the largest filing (ActBlue 1378435.fec) ever generated containing 24,656,453 contributions totaling $525,124,217.30.",not_spam

"I am looking to find a large dataset of searches for pornographic content both through search engines and sites themselves. Also any data on the images / videos actually viewed, categories selected by searchers etc.

I know that this information exists and is available from various sources but am unsure where in some cases or how to go about obtaining it in others.

The mother load would of course be Google data showing the terms directly entered into Google including sex and age range of the user.

I know pornhub release some great stats and they have given access to raw data to at least one author, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of ""Everybody Lies"" which included at least data on the sex of the searcher. However I don't know how I would get at this.

A good while ago there was the leaked AOL data though I can't find the raw data set.

I would love it if I could get hold of stats from say xnxx.com, kink.com etc.

Also if there are any other porn related datasets out there that would be great.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal**

I want to find out the emotion of my text from the classifier, then select an image with a similar emotion image from my image dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I've found so far?**

I've found multiple text sentiment datasets, but most of the times the emotion categories don't match with my image categories. Also, my text on interest is poetry, I wish I could get some dataset related to it. (Amazon reviews, tweets, etc. might not work well the poetry data I assume).

&amp;#x200B;

**What is ideal?**

If I can find a poetry/short songs lyrics dataset annotated with similar categories of emotions with my image dataset, it would be perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is ok?**

A text dataset which is annotated with similar categories of emotions with my image dataset (eg. Gloomy -&gt; Sad, Scary-&gt; Fear).

&amp;#x200B;

Have anyone worked on related stuff? Any help is greatly appreciated in advance.",not_spam
"Just hoping to gather some feedback on tracking stats at a live game.

I come from an analytics background and playing football at a decent level, our manager was interested in getting some stats on our upcoming season so I volunteered to record and put the report together so I'm just pondering how to go about recording the stats live in a play by play manner I can manage to fill in as the game is being played

Doing this as both a personal project and to help our team if I can

Any advice is helpful",not_spam

"Hi,

I'm looking for a dataset with traffic volume per cell.

The dataset should cover many years, to be able to exploit the periodicity, mobility and seasonality of the users behaviour.

"I'm not sure if this is the absolute best sub to put this, but search showed nothing more obvious. If you know of a better place to ask, let me know.

I'm looking for a list of something like 5,000 UK retail domains, basically any site that sells direct to consumer based in the UK.

I'm not trying to sell to these domains, so the costs of buying contact details through usual sources is not feasible. 

Anyone know where I should start to get that list?",not_spam
